#
# If you need to do some changes in a local-action used in this
# workflow, make sure you change the action-flag to your working
# branch-name to get the latest action functionality.
#
# Example: swisspost/design-system/.github/actions/setup-environment-pnpm@my-working-branch-name
#
# Don't forget to change the action-flag back to 'main',
# once you have finished your work on the local-action!
