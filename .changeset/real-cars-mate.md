Updated the file structure for the `post-footer` component global styles:

- dist/components/globals/post-footer.scss -> dist/components/footer/index.scss
- dist/components/globals/post-footer.css -> dist/components/footer/index.css

If you're importing one of these files manually in your project, you'll need to update the import path!
