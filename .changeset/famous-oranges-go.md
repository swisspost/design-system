Removed default svg-icons from all navigation entries.  
Introduced state-specific icons for individual components to indicate their current development status:
- In Progress ‚è≥: This component has open issues or tasks that need to be fixed before it can be used.
- Experimental üß™: This component has been newly introduced and you might experience some bumps while using it.
- Stable (No icon): This component is tested, has some mileage, other projects are already successfully implementing it, it's safe to use this.
- Deprecated ‚õî: This component will be removed in an upcoming major version.
