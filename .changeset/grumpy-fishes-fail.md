'@swisspost/design-system-tokens': patch
---

Added a transform function to avoid unitless zero values for specific token types (like `dimension`, etc.), which allows us to use these tokens also in css `calc()` functions.
Because `<number-token>`s are always interpreted as `<number>`s or `<integer>`s, "unitless 0" `<length>`s arenâ€™t supported in calc().
