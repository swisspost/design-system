Renamed the alert component to banner and updated the styles of banner and toast components. The class `.alert` is still supported for now but is deprecated and will be removed in v10. Changed web component `<post-alert>` to `<post-banner>`. Additionally, the classes `.{toast|alert}-primary`, `.{toast|alert}-gray` and `.toast-notification` have been deprecated.
