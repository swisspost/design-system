Renamed the alert component to banner and updated the styles of banner and toast components. The class `.alert` is still supported for now but it will be deprecated in v10. Changed web component `<post-alert>` to `<post-banner>`. Classes `.{toast|alert}-primary` and `.{toast|alert}-gray` have been deprecated.
