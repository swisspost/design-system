'@swisspost/design-system-changelog-github': patch
---

The &lt;sup&gt; construct does not work as intended in most contexts, adding unnecessary and confusing spacing into changelogs. New intended format:

- This is a contribution. (by username with #111)
- This is a multiline contribution that needs
  a lot of text (by username with #111)
