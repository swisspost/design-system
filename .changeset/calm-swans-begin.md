'@swisspost/design-system-styles': patch
---

Deprecated sizes "regular" and "medium" for text inputs, textareas and select boxes. Future major versions of the Design System will only support the sizes "small" and "large". This change will make it easier to decide what variant to use where: small for internal applications, large for customer facing external applications.
