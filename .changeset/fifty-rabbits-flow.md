Syncing versions of the following packages:

- @swisspost/design-system-styles
- @swisspost/design-system-components
- @swisspost/design-system-components-react
- @swisspost/design-system-components-angular

This will help understanding the dependencies between these packages at a glance but also means that for the individual pacakges, semver is no longer being used. This enables us also to talk about and document Design System versions as a whole instead of documenting the fragmented versions in a complex lookup table.
