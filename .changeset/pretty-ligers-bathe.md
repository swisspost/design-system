'@swisspost/design-system-components-angular': major
---

We are introducing the new package `@swisspost/design-system-components-angular` 🥳, which provides a corresponding Angular component for all our components.
For those working on an Angular app this means:

- Instead of the package `@swisspost/design-system-components`, which provides native web components, the new package can be used.
- The manual creation of Angular wrapper components for our previous web components in every project is no longer necessary.
- Full support of the standard Angular schema. The use of the `CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA` schema is history.
- Component properties, events, etc. can be applied to the components in the usual Angular way.
