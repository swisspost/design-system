# Elevation

<p className="lead">Elevation uses box shadows to give the impression of a distance between two elements along the z axis.</p>

The higher the elevation, the larger and softer the shadow, expressing a greater distance between an element and the one behind it.

<div className="elevation-container">
  {[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map((elevationLevel, i) => (
    <ElevationTile key={i} level={elevationLevel} />
  ))}
</div>

## Usage

### CSS class

The easiest way to add an elevation to an element is to apply an elevation class to it.

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <div className="w-50 rounded p-regular bg-aubergine elevation-5">I'm elevated!</div>
</Canvas>

### Sass

Import the elevation variables from the Design System Styles package from the `core` sass file with `@use`. This way, the elevation variables are scoped and don't mix with your own variables.

```css dark
@use '@swisspost/design-system-styles/core' as post;

.elevated-element {
  box-shadow: post.$elevation-5;
}
```
