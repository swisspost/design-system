### Major Changes

- Restricted badges to showcase counts exclusively and set their color to red by default.  
  Use tags to display states, properties, or other metadata. Opt for chips when presenting dismissible or selectable information.

  Use the background utility classes to change the badge color as needed. (by [@alizedebray](https://github.com/alizedebray) with [#2860](https://github.com/swisspost/design-system/pull/2860))

- Refactored brand colors. Renamed `$gray-background` SCSS variable to `$gray` and removed `$gray-background-light` variable because it is a duplication of the already existing variable `$light`.  
  Updated the usage of said variables in dependant packages accordingly. (by [@oliverschuerch](https://github.com/oliverschuerch) with [#2861](https://github.com/swisspost/design-system/pull/2861))

  - @swisspost/design-system-components
  - @swisspost/design-system-components-react
  - @swisspost/design-system-components-angular
  - @swisspost/design-system-migrations
  - @swisspost/design-system-icons
  - @swisspost/design-system-intranet-header

  Instead use the variables `$success`, `$error`, `$warning` and the Sass map `$signal-colors`.

  - Updated the Sass map `$signal-colors` keys and added a new Sass map `$signal-background-colors`.
  - Updated the Sass map `$background-colors` and all the dependant packages accordingly.

  With the exception of the components `notification`, `toast` and `tag`, there is no component providing a `danger` variant anymore. Instead use the `error` variant. (by [@oliverschuerch](https://github.com/oliverschuerch) with [#2861](https://github.com/swisspost/design-system/pull/2861))

- Deprecated the base64 icons defined as CSS backgrounds. This technology is outdated and contributes a large amount to the CSS bloat.

- Updated the algorithm for calculating color contrast and optimal text color based on a given background color. Texts on colored buttons now comply with the WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines. (by [@gfellerph](https://github.com/gfellerph) with [#1154](https://github.com/swisspost/design-system/pull/1154))

## 5.2.0

## 5.1.3

### Patch Changes

- When outside days get hidden, they collapse in their flex context and change the alignment of the first days of the month. Adding flex-grow 1 ensures the hidden days still keep their space so the day labels on top match correctly with the calendar days. (by [@gfellerph](https://github.com/gfellerph) with [#793](https://github.com/swisspost/design-system/pull/793))

## 5.1.1

## 5.0.0

### Major Changes

- Refactored the stepper component in order to facilitate its use within a project.
  <br><sup>by [@alizedebray](https://github.com/alizedebray) with [#308](https://github.com/swisspost/design-system/pull/308)</sup>

- Refactored colors. Bootstrap overrides are now clearly separated from Design System colors and only Design System colors are used in the components. This change also prepares for a dynamic dark mode by offering CSS variables for background and text contrast colors (see `buttons.scss` for an example).
  <br><sup>by [@gfellerph](https://github.com/gfellerph) with [#96](https://github.com/swisspost/design-system/pull/96)</sup>

- Added requirement for `width` and `height` attributes on images in the topic-teaser component to be set to `100%`. To be able to display the image properly in firefox and safari.

- Added and extended grid-cols definition for `.topic-teaser-content` and `.topic-teaser-image-container` containers inside css and removed col classes from html. Improved image `aspect-ratios`, as well as `font-size` and `padding` of `.link-list` elements on smaller devices.
  <br><sup>by [@oliverschuerch](https://github.com/oliverschuerch) with [#310](https://github.com/swisspost/design-system/pull/310)</sup>

- Updated entry file names for the styles package.

  ```scss
  @use '@swisspost/design-system-styles'; // Default internet styles
  @use '@swisspost/design-system-styles/intranet'; // Default intranet styles
  @use '@swisspost/design-system-styles/core' as post; // Variables, mixins, functions and placeholders
  ```

  1. Default import is now as simple as possible.
  2. Intranet styles are clearly named as such.
  3. Core functionality is a clear name, but for consistency with other prefixes, the core module can be namespaced as post. The usage would then be `background-color: post.$yellow;`.
     <br><sup>by [@gfellerph](https://github.com/gfellerph) with [#389](https://github.com/swisspost/design-system/pull/389)</sup>

- Added storybook for documenting the basic styles.

- Removed deprecated scss-variables `$font-size-map`, `$font-size-sm`, `$font-size-rg` and `$font-size-lg` from project, in favor of the new `$font-sizes` map.
  <br><sup>by [@oliverschuerch](https://github.com/oliverschuerch) with [#189](https://github.com/swisspost/design-system/pull/189)</sup>

- Refactored `font-size` and `line-height` maps with keys, for easier automation. Variables now are always accessible individually and collected in a loopable map. Font-sizes and line-heights are defined for the same sizes so it's possible to cross-reference a line-height based on font-size (see font-curve mixin).
  <br><sup>by [@gfellerph](https://github.com/gfellerph) with [#115](https://github.com/swisspost/design-system/pull/115)</sup>

- Refactored background classes (`.bg-{colorname}`) for the alert and notification component.
