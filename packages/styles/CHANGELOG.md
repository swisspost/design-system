## 5.2.0

### Minor Changes

### Patch Changes

## 5.1.3

### Patch Changes

## 5.1.2

- When outside days get hidden, they collapse in their flex context and change the alignment of the first days of the month. Adding flex-grow 1 ensures the hidden days still keep their space so the day labels on top match correctly with the calendar days. (by [@gfellerph](https://github.com/gfellerph) with [#793](https://github.com/swisspost/design-system/pull/793))

## 5.1.1

### Major Changes

- Refactored the stepper component in order to facilitate its use within a project.
  <br><sup>by [@alizedebray](https://github.com/alizedebray) with [#308](https://github.com/swisspost/design-system/pull/308)</sup>

- Refactored colors. Bootstrap overrides are now clearly separated from Design System colors and only Design System colors are used in the components. This change also prepares for a dynamic dark mode by offering CSS variables for background and text contrast colors (see `buttons.scss` for an example).
  <br><sup>by [@gfellerph](https://github.com/gfellerph) with [#96](https://github.com/swisspost/design-system/pull/96)</sup>

- Added requirement for `width` and `height` attributes on images in the topic-teaser component to be set to `100%`. To be able to display the image properly in firefox and safari.
  <br><sup>by [@gfellerph](https://github.com/gfellerph) with [#350](https://github.com/swisspost/design-system/pull/350)</sup>

- Added and extended grid-cols definition for `.topic-teaser-content` and `.topic-teaser-image-container` containers inside css and removed col classes from html. Improved image `aspect-ratios`, as well as `font-size` and `padding` of `.link-list` elements on smaller devices.
  <br><sup>by [@oliverschuerch](https://github.com/oliverschuerch) with [#310](https://github.com/swisspost/design-system/pull/310)</sup>

- Updated entry file names for the styles package.

  ```scss
  @use '@swisspost/design-system-styles'; // Default internet styles
  @use '@swisspost/design-system-styles/intranet'; // Default intranet styles
  @use '@swisspost/design-system-styles/core' as post; // Variables, mixins, functions and placeholders
  ```

  1. Default import is now as simple as possible.
  2. Intranet styles are clearly named as such.
  3. Core functionality is a clear name, but for consistency with other prefixes, the core module can be namespaced as post. The usage would then be `background-color: post.$yellow;`.
     <br><sup>by [@gfellerph](https://github.com/gfellerph) with [#389](https://github.com/swisspost/design-system/pull/389)</sup>

- Added storybook for documenting the basic styles.

  <br><sup>by [@gfellerph](https://github.com/gfellerph) with [#355](https://github.com/swisspost/design-system/pull/355)</sup>

  <br><sup>by [@oliverschuerch](https://github.com/oliverschuerch) with [#188](https://github.com/swisspost/design-system/pull/188)</sup>

- Css variables originating from the Design System are now prefixed with `--post-{variablename}`. Css variables from bootstrap are prefixed with `--bs-{variablename}`.
  <br><sup>by [@gfellerph](https://github.com/gfellerph) with [#361](https://github.com/swisspost/design-system/pull/361)</sup>

- Removed deprecated scss-variables `$font-size-map`, `$font-size-sm`, `$font-size-rg` and `$font-size-lg` from project, in favor of the new `$font-sizes` map.
  <br><sup>by [@oliverschuerch](https://github.com/oliverschuerch) with [#189](https://github.com/swisspost/design-system/pull/189)</sup>

- Refactored `font-size` and `line-height` maps with keys, for easier automation. Variables now are always accessible individually and collected in a loopable map. Font-sizes and line-heights are defined for the same sizes so it's possible to cross-reference a line-height based on font-size (see font-curve mixin).
  <br><sup>by [@gfellerph](https://github.com/gfellerph) with [#115](https://github.com/swisspost/design-system/pull/115)</sup>
