# Alert

Provide contextual feedback messages for typical user actions with the handful of available and flexible alert messages.<br/>
Alerts are available for any length of text, as well as an optional close button.
By default Alerts will be rendered with a contextually appropriate icon.

## Variants

For proper styling, use one of the required contextual classes (e.g., .alert-primary, .alert-success, ...).

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-alert--contextual-variants" />
</Canvas>
<ArgsTable story="components-alert--contextual-variants" />

## Additional Content

Alerts can also contain additional HTML elements like headings, paragraphs and dividers.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-alert--additional-content"></Story>
</Canvas>

## Alert without Icon

Alerts can be also showed with or without the big Icons on the left.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-alert--without-icon"></Story>
</Canvas>

## Dismissible Alert

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-alert--dismissible"></Story>
</Canvas>

## Fixed Alert

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-alert--fixed"></Story>
</Canvas>
