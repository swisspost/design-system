# Web Styles Migrations

Schematics to transform a software project by adapting it to current Web Styles.

## Testing

To test locally, install `@angular-devkit/schematics-cli` globally and use the `schematics` command line tool. That tool acts the same as the `generate` command of the Angular CLI, but also has a debug mode.

Check the documentation with

```bash
schematics --help
```

## Unit Testing

`npm run test` will run the unit tests, using Jasmine as a runner and test framework.
