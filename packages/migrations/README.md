# Design System Migrations

Scripts to migrate an Angular application from one Design System version to another.

## Usage

The migration package is not intended to be installed as a dependency on your project.
You can install it temporarily while migrating your project to a new version of Design System, then uninstall it directly:

```bash
  npm install @swisspost/design-system-migrations
  npx ng update @swisspost/design-system-migrations --from=[currentVersion] --to=[targetedVersion] --migrate-only --allow-dirty
  npm uninstall @swisspost/design-system-migrations
```

Be sure to update your application one major Design System version at a time as explained in our [migration guide](https://design-system.post.ch/).
