### Major Changes

- Synchronized the versions of the following packages:

  - @swisspost/design-system-styles
  - @swisspost/design-system-components
  - @swisspost/design-system-components-react
  - @swisspost/design-system-components-angular
  - @swisspost/design-system-migrations
  - @swisspost/design-system-icons
  - @swisspost/design-system-intranet-header

  This will help understanding the dependencies between these packages at a glance but also means that for the individual pacakges, semver is no longer being used. This enables us also to talk about and document Design System versions as a whole instead of documenting the fragmented versions in a complex lookup table.
