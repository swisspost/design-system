# Contributing to the Design System ESLint Plugin


This guide will walk you through the steps required to get started and create new custom rules.
Please note that these guidelines extend the [general contribution guidelines](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) from the root of the repository.

## Getting Started

### Build the Rules

To build the ESLint plugin for production, run:

```bash
pnpm eslint:build
```

### Inspect the Configs

To inspect the ESLint ESLint configs as you develop them, run:

```bash
pnpm eslint:play
```

### Run Unit Tests

To run the unit tests for the ESLint plugin, use the following command:

```bash
pnpm eslint:test
```

## Writing Custom Rules

When creating a new custom rule, you need to create three separate files:

1. **Rule Implementation** in the `src/rules` directory
2. **Rule Tests** in the `tests/rules` directory 
3. **Rule Documentation** in the `docs/rules` directory

Each of these files must have the same name as the rule.
For example, if you're creating the rule `no-foo`, the files should be named like this:

- `src/rules/no-foo.ts`
- `tests/rules/no-foo.spec.ts`
- `docs/rules/no-foo.md`

### Rule Structure

The rule file should export two things:

- The rule name
- The rule implementation

The rule implementation is created using the `createRule()` function.
It takes the following configuration:

```ts
{
  name: string;
  meta: RuleMetaData;
  defaultOptions: [];
  create: (context: RuleContext, options: []) => RuleListener;
}
```

- **name**: The name of the rule (e.g. `no-foo`).
- **meta**: An object containing all necessary information about the rule.
- **defaultOptions**: Optional default values for any configuration options for the rule.
- **create**: The function where you implement the rule logic. A detailed guide on writing custom rules is available in the ESLint Custom Rule Tutorial.

_More details about the structure can be found in the [ESLint documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/extend/custom-rules#rule-structure)._

### Writing Html Rules

Html rules are specific to HTML and use a custom parser.
This parser is located in the `src/parsers/html` folder.
It allows you to target HTML nodes such as `tag`, `text`, and `comment`.

Hereâ€™s an example of a simple rule that checks for the presence of `button` tags:

```ts
{
  create(context) {
    return {
      tag(node: HtmlNode) {
        if (node.name === 'button') {
          context.report({
            node,
            message: 'Button tags are not allowed',
          });
        }
      },
    };
  }
}
```

#### Html Node Properties

Each html node is represented by a `HtmlNode` object.
Key properties include:

- **type**: The type of node (e.g., `tag`, `text`, `comment`).
- **name**: The name of the node (e.g., `div`, `button`, `p`)). The name is optional.
- **range**: A tuple of the start and end positions of the node in the source code.
- **loc**: The position of the node in the source code, with `start.line`, `start.column`, `end.line`, and `end.column`.
- **toCheerio()**: A method to convert the node into a [Cheerio class](https://cheerio.js.org/docs/api/classes/Cheerio).

Additionally, the **context** object provides access to the [Cheerio API](https://cheerio.js.org/docs/api/interfaces/CheerioAPI) via `context.sourceCode.parserServices.cheerioAPI`.

#### Testing Html Rules

To test html rules, use the `HtmlRuleTester.run()` function.
This allows you to provide sample HTML strings for testing valid and invalid rule cases.

## Exporting Rules

Rules can be exported for two different purposes:

- **Linting**: To be used in the consumer's ESLint configuration.
- **Migration**: To be used once for automatically migrating a project to a new version of the Design System.

Depending on the purpose, the rules should be exported in the appropriate `index.ts` file.
It will then be automatically exported in the correct way.
