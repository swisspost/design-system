## Properties

### Positioning method of elements

Here are the different positioning methods available for elements.

- `position-static` (default) positions the element according to the flow of the page.
- `position-relative` positions the element according to the flow of the page, but you can offset it relatively to itself by settings values for `top`, `bottom`, `start` and `end`.
- `position-absolute` removes the element from the flow of the page and positions it relatively to its closest positioned element.
- `position-fixed` removes the element from the flow of the page and positions it relatively to the viewport.
- `position-sticky` positions the element according to the flow of the page but "sticks" it in place in the case of a scrolling container.

### Arrangement of elements

Some utility classes are here to define the position from the edges of the container more easily.

- `top-{0|50|100}` to set the position of the element from the top of the container by 0, 50% or 100%.
- `bottom-{0|50|100}` to set the position of the element from the bottom of the container by 0, 50% or 100%.
- `start-{0|50|100}` to set the position of the element from the start of the container (left in LTR) by 0, 50% or 100%.
- `end-{0|50|100}` to set the position of the element from the end of the container (right in LTR) by 0, 50% or 100%.

### Translate-middle

The class `.translate-middle` is there to center an element horizontally and vertically on their x and y position. You can also use `.translate-middle-x` to only center the element horizontally and `.translate-middle-y` to center it vertically.

<Canvas sourceState="hidden" of={PositionStories.TranslateMiddle} />

On the example above, the black dot is the center of the container. Both squares are positioned 50% from the top and 50% from the start. The blue square has the `translate-middle` class and the yellow one doesn't.
