# Spacing

<div className="lead">
Our spacing utility brings uniform and consistent spacing to your elements,

By adhering to standardized spacing guidelines, we maintain visual alignment and
improve the overall user interface.

<div className="alert alert-warning mb-bigger-big">
  <h2 className="alert-heading">Sizing variables are deprecated</h2>
  <p>The current set of the post-specific spacing utility is deprecated in favour of a new naming system that is consistent with the Design. For further information, please read the <a href="https://github.com/swisspost/design-system/discussions/588">discussion on sizing variables on GitHub</a> and have a look at the <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/ojCcgC5Zd12eUSzq6V5m24/Foundations?node-id=3%3A2&t=l8qimsXlxeMLOzs6-0">implementation in Figma</a>.</p>
  <p>There is a new solution with updated naming system up coming for spacing sizes.</p>

## Padding & Margin

You can apply the desired spacings for `margin` and/or `padding` all around an element using the classes `m-*` and `p-*`, or you can specify a position (e.g. `pt-*` , `pb-*` , `pe-*` , `ps-*` respectively for a padding at top, bottom, end/right and start/left). You can also set a spacing along the horizontal axis (i.e. right and left) using `mx-*` / `px-*` or along the vertical axis (i.e. top and bottom) using `my-*` / `py-*` .

Our base spacing classes with suffixes going from 0 to 5 (`*-0`, `*-1`, ..., `*-5`).

Our custom sizes can be used in the same way: by adding the name of the desired size to a prefix. See our [sizing docs](/?path=/docs/e728de1f-0d71-4317-8bb8-cbef0bf8d5db--docs) to find out which size names are available.

<div className="alert alert-warning">
  <h4 className="alert-heading">Do not use spacing classes on grid elements (i.e. `.row`, `.col`, `.col-*`).</h4>
  <p>Our grid is built with negative margins and positive paddings on the x-axis. Therefore, use this spacing classes only if you know exactly what you are doing!</p>

## Responsive behavior

By default, the above classes apply to all breakpoints.

##### Manually specifying breakpoints

If you need to change the size or spacing of an element based on the breakpoint, you should
mention it in the class name using one of the following infixes: {Object.values(SpacingStories.SCSS_VARIABLES.breakpoints).map((s, index, array) => (<span><code>{`-${s}-`}</code>{index !== array.length - 1 && ', '}</span>))}.
When a breakpoint is specified, the size applies to that breakpoint and to all those that are
larger.

The square below has a big padding from the large breakpoint (i.e. `.p-lg-big`) and a regular
padding below (i.e. `.p-regular`).

##### Using automatic responsive behavior

Another way to define a responsive size is to use the `-r` suffix. It allows to obtain a size which updates automatically and consistently depending on the breakpoint, without having to specify anything manually.

The square below has a "large" responsive padding, which means the padding size
automatically changes based on the breakpoint but remains visually consistent.
