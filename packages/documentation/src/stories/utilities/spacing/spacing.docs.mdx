# Spacing

<div className="lead">
  Spacing values bring a uniform and consistent distance between elements.

  By adhering to standardized spacing guidelines, we maintain visual alignment and
  improve the overall user interface.

  <h2 class="alert-heading">Sizing variables are deprecated</h2>
  <p>
    The current set of the post-specific sizing variables is deprecated in favour of a new naming system that is
    consistent with the Design. For further information, please read the
    <a href="https://github.com/swisspost/design-system/discussions/588">discussion on sizing variables on GitHub</a>
    and have a look at the

  <p><b>There is a new solution with updated naming system up coming for spacing sizes.</b></p>

## Padding & Margin

Padding and margin can be set using `p*` and `m*` prefixes.

You can apply the desired margin / padding all around an element using the prefix alone ( `m-*` / `p-*` ), or you can specify a position (ex: `pt-` , `pb-` , `pe-` , `ps-` respectively for a padding at top, bottom, right and left). You can also set a margin/padding along the horizontal axis (i.e. right and left) using `px-` / `mx-` or along the vertical axis (i.e. top and bottom) using `py`- / `my-` .

Bootstrap offers spacing classes with suffixes going from 0 to 5 ( `*-0` , `*-1` , `*-2` , ...) (see [Bootstrap Spacing](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/utilities/spacing/) for reference).

Post sizes can be used in the same way: by adding the name of the desired size to a prefix (to find out which size name to use, see the "Size name in classes" column in the reference table on the [Sizing page](/?path=/docs/utilities-sizing--docs) or use the demo below).

### Example

<Canvas of={SpacingStories.Default} />
<div className="hide-col-default">
  <Controls of={SpacingStories.Default} />
</div>

## Responsive behavior

By default, the above classes apply to all breakpoints.

If you need to change the size or spacing of an element based on the breakpoint, you should
mention it in the class name using one of the following infixes: `-sm-`, `-rg-`, `-md-`, `-lg-`, `-xl-`, `-xxl-`.
When a breakpoint is specified, the size applies to that breakpoint and to all those that are
larger.

Another way to define a responsive size is to use the `-r` suffix. It allows to obtain a size which updates automatically and consistently depending on the breakpoint, without having to specify anything manually.

### Example

##### Manually specifying breakpoints

The square below has a "big" padding from the large (-lg-) breakpoint and a "regular"
padding below.

<Canvas of={SpacingStories.responsiveExample} />

##### Using automatic responsive behavior

The square below has a "large" responsive padding, which means the padding size
automatically changes based on the breakpoint but remains visually consistent.

<Canvas of={SpacingStories.gridGap} />
