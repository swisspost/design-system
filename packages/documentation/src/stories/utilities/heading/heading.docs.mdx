# Headings

<div className="lead">
  Use heading utility classes when you want to match the font styling of a heading but cannot
  use the associated HTML element.
</div>

<div className="alert alert-warning">
  Never skip a heading level. Maintaining a semantically correct heading structure helps users
  of assistive technologies and search engines understand your content. Sometimes the correct
  HTML heading element does not match the expected heading style. In this case, you can use
  heading utility classes to ensure that your header structure is semantically correct while
  conforming to design requirements.
