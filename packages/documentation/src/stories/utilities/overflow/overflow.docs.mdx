# Overflow

<div className="lead">Define how a content overflows its container.</div>
<br />
<div className="alert alert-info">Note that these utility classes are not responsive.</div>

</div>

## Properties

The properties available for the overflow of elements are the following:

- `overflow` for the overflow of the content both horizontally and vertically.
- `overflow-x` for the overflow of the content horizontally.
- `overflow-y` for the overflow of the content vertically.

The values available are the following:

- `visible` (default) sets all of the content to be visible and will overflow the container if needed.
- `auto` lets the browser decide what to do and will add scrollbar if needed.
- `hidden` hides all of the content that would overflow the container, without any scrollbars.
- `scroll` does not overflow the content and adds scrollbars to the container.

<div className="alert alert-info alert-sm">
  If one of the axis is defined as `visible`, and the other axis is defined as something else, then
  the `visible` axis will be considered to be `auto`.
</div>
