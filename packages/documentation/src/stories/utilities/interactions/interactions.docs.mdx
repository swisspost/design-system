# Interactions

<div className="lead">
  Use pointer events and user select classes to define how users interact with your content.
</div>

## Pointer events

- `pe-none`: Prevents pointer interactions on links and controls.
- `pe-auto`: Enables pointer interactions (default).

Note that setting `pe-none` to an element only prevents interactions with pointers (mouse, stylus, touch) but keyboard users can still interact with it.

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={Interactions.PointerEvents} />

### User select

- `user-select-all`: The whole context of the selection will be selected automatically.
- `user-select-auto`: Only the part selected by the user is selected (default).
- `user-select-none`: The text of the element is not selectable.
