# Sizing

<div className="lead">
  Sizing utility classes are used to influence the height and width of elements to which they are
  applied.
</div>

## Height & Width

    Height and width can be set using `h-*` and `w-*` prefixes, max-height and max-width can be set using prefixes `mh-*` and `mw-*` and min height and min width can be set using the prefixes `min-h` and `min-w`.

### Parent Based

The design system offers sizing classes with the suffixes bellow. They allow you to set a height / width as a percentage of the parent element.

> - `*-25`
> - `*-50`
> - `*-75`
> - `*-100`

#### Example

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={SizingStories.SizesPercent} />
<div className="hide-col-default">
  <Controls of={SizingStories.SizesPercent} />
</div>

### Relative to breakpoints

For width, we offer additionally `.w-{breakpoint}-{size}` classes (e.g. `w-md-100`) so that you can size only for some specific breakpoints.

See <a href="/?path=/docs/eb78afcb-ce92-4990-94b6-6536d5ec6af4--docs#full-width">Full-width button</a> for a practical example.

## Viewport Based

There is the possibility to set the width and height relative to the viewport.

> - `min-vh-100`
> - `min-vw-100`
> - `vh-100`
> - `vw-100`
