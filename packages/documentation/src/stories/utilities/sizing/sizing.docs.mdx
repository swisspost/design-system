# Sizing

<div className="lead">
  Sizing utility classes are used to influence the height and width of elements to which they are
  applied.
</div>

## Height & Width

Height and width can be set using our utility classes `h-{size}` and `w-{size}`, max-height and max-width can be set with `max-h-{size}` and `max-w-{size}` and min-height and min-width can be set with `min-h-{size}` and `min-w-{size}`.

### Parent Based

The design system offers classes for percentage based sizing with the suffixes bellow. They allow you to set a height / width as a percentage of the parent element.

- `*-auto`
- `*-quarter`
- `*-third`
- `*-half`
- `*-two-thirds`
- `*-three-quarters`
- `*-full`

### Example

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={SizingStories.PercentSizes} />
<div className="hide-col-default">
  <Controls of={SizingStories.PercentSizes} />
</div>

### Pixel Based

Additional pixel-based sizing classes allow precise height `h-{size}` and width `w-{size}` definitions in pixels (e.g., `w-12` for 12px width and `h-26` for 26px height).

See all available sizes in the example bellow.

### Example

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={SizingStories.PxSizes} />
<div className="hide-col-default">
  <Controls of={SizingStories.PxSizes} />
</div>

### Relative to breakpoints

For width and height, the design system provides additionally `.w-{breakpoint}-{size}` classes (e.g. `w-md-full`, `h-md-56`) so that you can set different sizes for specific breakpoints.

See <a href="/?path=/docs/eb78afcb-ce92-4990-94b6-6536d5ec6af4--docs#full-width">Full-width button</a> for a practical example.

### Viewport Based

There is the possibility to set the width and height as a percentage relative to the viewport. Available percentages: `25`, `33`, `50`, `66`, `75`, `100`.

> - `min-vh-100`
> - `min-vw-100`
> - `vh-100`
> - `vw-100`
