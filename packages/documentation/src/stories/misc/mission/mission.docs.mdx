# Swiss Post Mission

The Swiss Post Design System enables project teams to create seamless user experiences across all digital touchpoints by providing patterns, guidance and tools.

## Who Uses the Design System?

<ul className="roles-list no-style-list">
  {roles.map((role, index) => (
    <li key={index} className="role-item list-item">
      <strong>{role.role}</strong>
      <div className="role-description">{role.description}</div>
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>

### The Design System is well represented and supported by our stakeholders, including:

<ul className="stakeholders-list no-style-list row row-cols-1 row-cols-md-3">
  {stakeholders.map((stakeholder, index) => (
    <li key={index} className="stakeholder-item list-item centered-item col">
      {stakeholder.role}
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>

### Documentation

Entry points to the Design System are public. All documentation is written in English and uses common terminology. The documentation platforms are in sync with implementations and cross-linked. Regular updates ensure that the documentation stays aligned with the latest changes and best practices.

### Core Team

<ul className="team-list no-style-list row">
  {teamMembers.map((teamMember, index) => (
    <li
      key={index}
      className="team-item list-item centered-item col-sm-12 col-md-4 col-lg-3 flex-lg-column"
    >
      <post-icon
        name={teamMember.icon}
        style={{ fontSize: '3rem' }}
        className="team-icon"
      ></post-icon>
      {teamMember.name}
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>

These contributors are responsible for major implementations and play a central role in shaping the system. To ensure meaningful input, they have allocated time and budget to actively participate in the project, both in Figma and Web development.

### Quality & Compliance
