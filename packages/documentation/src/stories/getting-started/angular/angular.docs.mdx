# Angular

The Swiss Post Design System is compatible with Angular. Here are some tips, best practices and information to include components the easiest way.

## Usage of Web Components

In the design-system team, we believe that the [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Components) technologies should be the source for almost all, if not all, future components.

Currently, we are providing some of our packages with those technologies:
<ul className="tile-wrapper" role="list">
  {packages.filter(pkg => pkg.type === PackageType.Wc).map((p => (
    <li key={p.name}>
      <ti-le title={p.name} href={p.link.docs.href} ariaLabel={p.link.docs.ariaLabel}>
        <img src={p.img.src} alt={p.img.alt}/>
        <span>{p.version}</span>
      </ti-le>
    </li>
  )))}
</ul>

Even though, Angular support Web components technologies natively, they are less convenient to use than regular Angular components.
To mitigate the problem, we are providing packages that add Angular wrapper around Custom Elements.

<table className="table caption-top">
  <caption>Why you should use or not use Angular wrapper package</caption>
  <colgroup>
    <col style={{width: '25%'}} />
    <col style={{width: '25%'}} />
  </colgroup>

      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>Type-checking</li>
          <li>Angular component wrappers will be detached from change detection, preventing unnecessary repaints of your web component</li>
          <li>Web component events will be converted to RxJS observables to align with Angular's `@Output()` and will not emit across component boundaries.</li>
          <li>Optionally, form control web components can be used as control value accessors with Angular's reactive forms or `[ngModel]`.</li>
          <li>It is not necessary to include the Angular `CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA` in all modules consuming your Stencil components.</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>Package is linked to a (minimal) angular version</li>
          <li>As the packages are generated automatically, the design-system team has less control</li>
        </ul>

### Angular wrapper package

For the components package, we provide the equivalent package called [components-angular](/?path=/docs/833ef689-a573-40f5-a6a6-30a999b94733--docs) which contains a wrapper for Angular generated (almost) automatically.

Note: at the moment, we do not provide any equivalent for internet-header package, so you'll need to add them manually.

### Declare manually Web components

In addition to define all or a specific components in `main.ts` (see Usage section of the package), you need to declare to Angular that you'll add Custom Elements to your application with the `schema` property in every module where you need to use the components.

<Source code={SampleWcAngularManually} language="typescript" />

## Serve the icons within your application

Icons from the design-system are stored in the icons package. To used them, you need to serve the image files from your application.
Angular allows you to copy assets into the build by changing the `angular.json` configuration like this:

<Source code={SampleIconsConfig} language="json" />
