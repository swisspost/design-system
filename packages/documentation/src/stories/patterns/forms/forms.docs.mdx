# How to forms

## Page layout

All things need to be contained inside a container. The container limits the size of the content and centers it on the page.

<Source
  code={`<div class="container">...</div>`}
  language="html"
/>

## Basic input

For accessibility reasons, form fields should always have a label linked via the id/for
attributes. Screen-readers will announce the label when the input gets the focus. If there is no
label, screen-reader users have no idea what the input should be, even if there is other text
next to the field.

## Vertical spacing
To add space between input, you can use [margin utilities](/?path=/docs/facaacfd-18f1-49b4-80f1-a96680730fa0--docs).

## Rows'n'cols

If you want a form field to span the whole available width, you don't need a row nor a col. You
only need those, if you want to place two things next to each other.

Simply use `.row` and `.col` to have the width distributed evenly between all inputs.
To make it responsive, you can add `.row-cols-*` classes to the row (see [Grid page](/?path=/docs/7240f2ef-216a-490e-9bd8-c0cef19f7b31--docs#row-columns)).

For finer adjustment, you can also use the `.col-*` classes (see [Columns page](/?path=/docs/cd70f48f-6308-4ec8-a8c6-982bd72c855c--docs)) on your columns. For example for a 2/1 ratio, given that a row has twelve columns in total,
just add `.col-8` and `.col-4` to you two columns respectively.

## Fields with custom width

Some fields may not fit into the twelve row schema, they need a custom width. The PLZ field may
be one of those cases. Two `.col` next to each other will have equal width. If one of the cols has the
`.col-auto` class, this col is sized based on it's content. The other row is stretched to the container
width. With this setup, we can define a max-width on the input field to shrink it.

## Form buttons

Buttons, often at the end of the form are right aligned. We can achieve this with the classes `d-flex flex-row-reverse`. This will ensure that the primary button is focused first (because of the markup order) but is
still aligned to the right. To get some margin between the button we can use the `.gap-8` class. Note that for the buttons, we don't need any row/col structure.

## Floating labels

For internet applications, bigger input fields with floating labels are the Post way of creating
forms. The particularity of these fields, is that the `<label>` and `<input>`
elements are inverted and wrapped in a `.form-floating` div.
In addition, the input field needs a placeholder attribute, preferably equal to a single space.

## Validation messages

Validation messages are placed directly after the `<input>`
(or after the `<label>` in the case of floating label). Showing and hiding of these messages is typically controlled by
adding and removing validation classes on the input:

* The message needs the class `.invalid-feedback/.valid-feedback`
* The form needs the class `.was-validated`. With this class you can manage when to display errors. Usually, errors should not be
shown on untouched fields.

 Or

 The input field needs the class `.is-invalid/.is-valid`

## Hints

Hints can help users better understand the type of information they need to provide. Hints, like
validation messages, must be placed after the `<input>` (or `<label>`
in the case of floating label) and after validation messages if there are some.

Hints use the class `.form-text`.

To enable screen-readers to detect and read your hints, link the `<input>`
with the aria-describedby attribute to the hint via id.
