# Metadata

<div className="lead">
  Metadata is used to communicate additional information about your website to webbrowser, accessible devices or other applications.
</div>

The meta-tag has attributes for some general page settings but can also be used to define other metadata using specific names.
On this page you will find links to other pages that explain some of those names and what they can be used for.

    - [Standard names](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta/name)

## Open Graph Tags

Open Graph Tags are used to provide a more detailed description as well as a preview image about the content of a page. This informations can be used to display links in a more appealing way, when they are shared on platforms like X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, Microsoft Teams and many more...
X introduced custom meta-tags to specify special elements like card, etc., although there is also some support for open graph tags.
To use open grah tags you should put `prefix="og: http://ogp.me/ns#"` as attribute to either the `html` or the `head` tag, neither option is better than the other.

There is the possibility to provide a specific page in different languages using metadata. The page specififed with `hreflang="x-default"` is the page that will match for any language that is not specified in any `hreflang` attribute on this page. 
Please note that the current page and its language alternatives must be listed on each of this pages. [More information](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/specialty/international/localized-versions)
