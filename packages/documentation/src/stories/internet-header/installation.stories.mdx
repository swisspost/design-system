## Installation

### Angular, Vue JS, React (or any other bundler setup)

All the popular frameworks come with some form of bundler. This makes it easy to use npm packages like the Internet Header as you can import, bundle and deliver the header with your own code.

When working with Angular or any other framework, the easiest installation method is via npm.

```shell
npm install @swisspost/internet-header
```

```typescript
// main.ts / index.js / ...
import { defineCustomElements } from '@swisspost/internet-header';

defineCustomElements();
```

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<body>
  <swisspost-internet-header project="your-project-id"></swisspost-internet-header>
  ...
</body>
```

### Include from a CDN

If you are not using any loader or don't want to install from npm, you can load the `swisspost-internet-header.esm.js` from your favourite [CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network). There are two options available.

- [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/)
- [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/)

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<head>
  <script
    async
    type="module"
    src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/package/@swisspost/internet-header/dist/swisspost-internet-header/swisspost-internet-header.esm.js"
  ></script>
</head>
<body>
  <swisspost-internet-header project="your-project-id"></swisspost-internet-header>
</body>
```

## Configuration

The Internet Header is built to support the already existing Portal Configuration used for the old Internet Header. If you already have a configuration, you don't have to change it. If you are working on a new project, you can order a new configuration with the [Post Portal Team](mailto:digitalconsulting@post.ch).

Not every Online Service has configurations for all environments. For example, "TOPOS" only has `int02` configured and cannot use `int01` as value for environment. If you are not sure what's configured for your project, you can contact [digitalconsulting@post.ch](mailto:digitalconsulting@post.ch).

For settings on the header itself, see the examples provided in the left menu bar.

## Help

If you noticed a bug or need assistance with migrating to the new Internet Header, please post your enquiry at the [Design System Github Discussions](https://github.com/swisspost/design-system/discussions/categories/q-a).
