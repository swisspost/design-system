# Migration from the old header

This guide aims to give a broad overview of how a migration can be performed.
Different projects have different levels of integration with the header,
and therefore require more steps to migrate.

## Architecture

The "new"
Internet Header Web Component aims
to encapsulate as much as possible whereas the old header had a big influence on the page â€”
limiting design decisions and flexibility of the markup structure.
The Web Component Header consists of one script and three standard Web Components that can be freely placed on the page.
It's even possible to render those elements with Angular
(or any other framework) to easier pass settings into the component.

The new header is built
to work with the existing Sitecore configuration
already existing for your project to make the migration as smooth as possible.

## Support

If you need support during your migration,
don't hesitate
to contact the [Design System Team](https://github.com/swisspost/design-system/discussions/categories/general) on GitHub.

## 1. Remove the old header

In your index.html, you should find three scripts associated with the old header.
One to load static assets, one to configure it and one to load it.

- You can remove the configuration and the loader scripts, but remember your `serviceid`.
- Try to remove the `staticassets` script to check if you still need it

<Source
  code={SampleOld}
  dark={true}
  language="html"
/>

## 2. Fix your app styles

The old header was responsible for wrapping your main code (here `#os_content`) with custom `<div>`s.
The new header does not provide those wrappers.
Instead, every page has control over the main markup structure.
A possible replacement of the above code could be:

<Source
  code={SampleFixAppStyles}
  dark={true}
  language="html"
/>

- Likely you'll need the class `container` around your main content to align it properly in the center.
- For bonus points on semantic markup, use the [`<main>` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main) around the main page content
- Check if you need the `staticasset` stylesheets linked in the header

If you need to do any other changes,
please make a post to the [Design System Teams Channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3ae7fa68fb13eb40b4bf4604edea5f4b3e%40thread.tacv2/%25F0%259F%259A%2591%2520Support?groupId=123c7c9e-052a-40e6-98d3-6cc6d46bad0a&tenantId=3ae7c479-0cf1-47f4-8f84-929f364eff67)
in order to inform the devs to update this guide and provide useful information for other developers.

## 3. jQuery

The new Header does not ship jQuery anymore.
While jQuery v3.6 is an internal dependency for the Login Widget,
every project is now responsible for loading and updating jQuery individually.
If you are depending on an older (&lt;3.5) version of jQuery, please update.
There is a long list of [known jQuery vulnerabilities](https://security.snyk.io/package/npm/jquery).

## 4. Install the new header

Please refer to the [Internet Header installation instructions](/story/getting-started--page) for an installation guide.

After installation, you're ready to add the new tags to your markup:

<Source
  code={SampleInstall}
  dark={SourceDarkMode}
  language="html"
/>

Place the new elements as described (and needed) as shown above.
The breadcrumbs need a `container` wrapper to align themselves with the content of your page,
the header and the footer already provide a container.
If you don't have breadcrumbs, you can just delete the `<aside>` and the `<swisspost-internet-breadcrumbs>`.

## 5. Working with the new header

If you need to change settings during runtime, you can get a reference to the header by querying:

<Source
  code={SampleReference}
  dark={SourceDarkMode}
  language="typescript"
/>


At the [Internet Header configuration page](/story/header - usage--page) you can find a list of possible options.
