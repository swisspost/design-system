# Live Regions

A live region allows you to notify the user about a dynamic change without requiring the page to reload e.g. alert, loading status, chat logs, update of a product cart, feeds, etc.

They are defined either by using the `aria-live` attribute or some specific `role` attributes such as `role=status`, `role=alert`, `role=log`, etc.

## Implicit aria-live attribute with role attribute

`role=status`, `role=log` and `role=alert` have an implicit default `aria-live` attribute, however for a maximum compatibility, it is recommended to add it as well (except for `role=alert`). Source: [Roles with implicit live region attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions#roles_with_implicit_live_region_attributes)

## Choose the appropriate value for the aria-live attribute

`aria-live` attribute can be either:
* `polite`: message will be announced after the screen reader is idle.
* `assertive`: message will interrupt any announcement immediately. It should be used sparingly.

## Announce the whole Live region on change

By default, screen readers will only announce the part that changed. However, it's often better to repeat the context of the change.
To do so, we can add `aria-atomic=true` attribute on the live region. This attribute force screen readers to read the whole text.

For example on a shopping website, you want to announce to the user that a product was added to the shopping basket. If you announce only the product name, it's not enough to be comprehensive.

### Add or remove dynamically a live region

As a best practice, live region should be present on the page load and only the content inside it should change.

### Example with a spinner on Angular

When adding, for example, a spinner above a section, the live region container should be rendered initially while you can use `ng-container` to show and hide the spinner when you need it.

#### Good example

#### Bad example

You shouldn't add the whole region dynamically as the accessibility bindings might not be [updated with some screen readers](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2022/02/05/are-we-live.html#non-normative-rule-for-common-live-region-use-case).
