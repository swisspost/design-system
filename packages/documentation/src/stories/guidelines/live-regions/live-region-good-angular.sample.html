    There is some continuous text here as an example. This is placeholder text to demonstrate the
    layout and formatting of content within this component. The text flows naturally to show how
    paragraphs are displayed and how the spacing works. This sample content helps illustrate the
    appearance of actual text when the component is implemented in a real application.
