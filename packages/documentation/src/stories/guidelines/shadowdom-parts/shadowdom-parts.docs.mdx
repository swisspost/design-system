# Styling Shadow DOM Parts

<div className="lead">
  Any web component element within the Shadow DOM that has a `part` attribute can be styled by its
  direct parent DOM using the `::part` pseudo-element.
</div>

To style a shadow element with a `part` attribute:

- Identify the reference name assigned to the element's `part` attribute (e.g. `<element part="reference name">)`.
- Use the `::part` selector followed by the reference name (e.g. `::part(reference-name)`) to target and apply CSS styles.

### Example

<Source code={parts} language="html" />

<Source code={partsSass} language="scss" />

## Pseudo-classes & pseudo-elements

The `::part` selector supports the addition of pseudo-classes such as `:hover` and pseudo-elements like `::before` and `::after`. This enables precise styling for states and structural modifications of shadow DOM elements.

### Example

<Source code={pseudoParts} language="html" />

<Source code={pseudoPartsSass} language="scss" />

## Limitations

### Structural pseudo-classes

Structural pseudo-classes, such as `:nth-child` and `:first-child`, which depend on tree structure
and sibling relationships, cannot be applied to elements targeted by the `::part` selector. This restriction ensures that internal structure remains encapsulated and isn't exposed beyond the intended scope.

### Nested `::part` selectors

Each `part` must be directly exposed since styling cannot cascade through nested `::part` selectors.
The `::part selector` only targets the element associated with the specified part attribute. As a result, using nesting part selectors like `::part(header)::part(footer)` is not supported.
