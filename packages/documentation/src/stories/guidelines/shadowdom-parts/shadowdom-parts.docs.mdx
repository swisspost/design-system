# Styling Shadowdom Parts

## Parts

<div className="lead">
  The `part` attribute allows a shadow tree element to be exposed to its parent DOM.
</div>

To style an HTML shadow element, first set the `part` attribute on the element and assign it a name. Then, use the `::part` selector in your CSS to apply styles, referencing the name you specified in the `part` attribute. This allows you to style specific parts of a shadow DOM element from outside the shadow tree.

It is possible to append pseudo-classes such as `:hover`, `::before`, `::after` etc. to the `::part` selector. However, structural pseudo-classes that rely on tree information cannot be appended.

### Example

<Source code={parts} language="html" />

<Source code={partsSass} language="scss" />

## Exportparts

<div className="banner banner-info">
  <h4 className="banner-heading"> A `part` is visible only to its direct parent</h4>
  <p>
    Parts are not accessible from any ancestors other than their direct parent. However, it is
    possible to make a `part` globally available by defining it within the `exportparts` attribute
    of the component.
  </p>
</div>

The `exportparts` attribute allows specific parts of a shadow DOM element to be globally accessible,
meaning they can be styled from any ancestor outside the shadowtree.

### Example

<Source code={exportparts} language="html" />

<Source code={exportpartsSass} language="scss" />
