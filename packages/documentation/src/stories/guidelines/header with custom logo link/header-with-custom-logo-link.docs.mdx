# Header with Custom Logo Link

For client-side routing applications, such as those built with Angular, React, Next.js, etc., the `<post-header>` logo component, `<post-logo>`, can be adapted to fit the specific framework in use. This customization leverages client-side routing to prevent a full page reload when the logo is clicked, ensuring a smoother user experience. To achieve this, the `<post-logo>` component must be wrapped with a custom link wrapper that handles the routing logic according to the utilized framework.

## Steps to use `post-logo` with a Custom Link

<div className="fw-bold"> 1. Start by using the `<post-logo>` without a `url` prop:</div> When implementing a custom link, ensure the `<post-logo>` component does not have the `url` prop set, since this is intended only for rendering a standard HTML link.

<Source code={logoCode.firstStep} language="html" />

<div className="fw-bold">2. Implement a Custom Link Wrapper around the `<post-logo>`:</div> Develop a custom link wrapper that encapsulates the `<post-logo>` component. This wrapper should manage the routing logic in accordance with the framework being used.

<div className="fw-bold">3. Add the `slot="post-logo"` attribute to the Custom Link Wrapper:</div>
To ensure the `<post-logo>` component functions correctly within the header, the `post-logo` slot must be assigned to the link wrapper.
