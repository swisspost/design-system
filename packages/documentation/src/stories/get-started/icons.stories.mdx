# @swisspost/design-system-icons

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@swisspost%2Fdesign-system-icons.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/@swisspost%2Fdesign-system-icons)

There are currently two different approaches to use our icons:<br/>

- The first approach is to use our icons as an **svg-only** library,<br/>
- the second approach is to use our flexible, lightweight and easy-to-use **icon** component.

More information about the icons can be found under the [Icons Search](/?path=/docs/foundations-icons--page) or the [Icons Component](/?path=/docs/components-icon--default) documentation.

## Svg-only approach

With this approach, you get our icons as SVG files and manage their integration into your project yourself.

### Installation

```bash dark
npm install @swisspost/design-system-icons
```

### Usage

1. Define global styles to use for every post-icon in your application.

   ```css dark
   svg.post-icon {
     display: inline-block;
     width: 1em;
     height: auto;
     vertical-align: -0.15em;
   }
   ```

2. Get the icons you want to use.<br/>
   You can find them in our package under the path `@swisspost/design-system-icons/public/post-icons/{icon-name}.svg`.<br/>
   Use your own method to import them into your project or just copy the contents of the svg files into your HTML whenever you need an icon.

   ```html dark
   <svg
     class="post-icon"
     xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
     viewBox="0 0 32 32"
     xml:space="preserve"
   >
     <path
       fill="currentColor"
       d="M16 4C9.3 4 4 9.4 4 16s5.4 12 12 12 12-5.4 12-12S22.6 4 16 4zm0 1.3c2 0 3.9.6 5.5 1.6-1.5 1.7-6.8 6.6-14.7 3.7 1.9-3.2 5.3-5.3 9.2-5.3zm0 21.4c-5.9 0-10.7-4.8-10.7-10.7 0-1.5.3-2.9.9-4.2 1.9.7 3.8 1.1 5.4 1.1 5.8 0 9.7-3.8 11-5.2 2.5 2 4.1 5 4.1 8.4 0 5.8-4.8 10.6-10.7 10.6zm-3.3-10h-1.3c0-.4-.3-.7-.7-.7-.4 0-.7.3-.7.7H8.7c0-1.1.9-2 2-2s2 .9 2 2zm10.6 0H22c0-.4-.3-.7-.7-.7s-.7.3-.7.7h-1.3c0-1.1.9-2 2-2s2 .9 2 2zm-11.9 3.8h9.3v1.3h-9.3v-1.3z"
     ></path>
   </svg>
   ```

3. Be sure to add previously defined styles to each icon (e.g. add the `.post-icon` class to the svg tag).

## Post-Icon component approach

With this approach, you use our `<post-icon>` component which allows you to easily embed icons in your HTML code.<br/>
The component provides properties that let you quickly set where an icon is loaded from (cdn or self-hosted), how it displays and even if it is animated or not. It is also possible to manage a custom icon with our component.

### Installation

To use our icons with the `<post-icon>` component, you do not need to install the **icons package**, because the icons are loaded from the [unpkg CDN](https://unpkg.com/) by default. Instead, you need to install our **components package**.
Please follow the instructions on the [Components - Get Started](/?path=/docs/get-started-components--page) page to do so.

### Usage

Once the component package is installed, you can now simply use our icons in your project as follows:

```html dark
<post-icon name="1000"></post-icon>
```

For more detailed information about the `post-icon` component, continue reading the [post-icon documentation](/?path=/docs/components-post-icon--default).<br/>
A list of all icons is available [here](/?path=/docs/foundations-icons--page).

### Self-hosting the icons

Because depending on an external CDN may not be ideal for your project, we provide a way to self-host the SVG files on your server.<br/>
For the following instructions, we assume that the `<post-icon>` component has already been installed as described previously.

1. Install the [icons package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@swisspost/design-system-icons) from npm.

   ```bash dark
   npm install @swisspost/design-system-icons
   ```

2. In order for your project to access the installed icons, you need to copy them from our package to a `public` assets folder (this folder may have a different name in your project). All icons are available from `@swisspost/design-system-icons/public/post-icons/{icon-name}.svg`.

3. To let the `<post-icon>` component know where to find your self-hosted icons, set the following meta tag in the `head` section of your page.

   ```html dark
   <html lang="en">
     <head>
       <meta name="design-system-settings" data-post-icon-base="/your/path/to/post-icons/" />
       ...
     </head>
   </html>
   ```

If you don't have access to the `head` section or if you want to set a different path for just a few icons, you can also set the base path at the icon level:

```html dark
<post-icon base="/your/path/to/post-icons/" name="1001"></post-icon>
```
