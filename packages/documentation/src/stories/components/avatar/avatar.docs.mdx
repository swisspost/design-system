## Customize background and forground colors

The component provides some css-variables, which allow you to switch the background and the foreground color if needed.

<post-banner type="warning">Please ensure at all times, that the background and foreground colors have sufficient contrast!</post-banner>

```scss
post-avatar {
  --post-avatar-bg: {your-custom-bg-color};
  --post-avatar-fg: {your-custom-fg-color};
}
```

## Properties

The `<post-avatar>` component provides several possibilities to change its appearance. While the only required property is `firstname`, you can choose freely, which of the other properties you want to use. You can even combine them. The component will always try to show a picture, if possible, and fallback to initials, if not.
Please notice, that if you combine several methods to show a picture, the component will use the first one it can get a picture from.

The properties are used in the order as follows:

1. If you use an `<img>` tag in the default slot (for example to show a self hosted image), this will override the other properties.<br/><br/>
   <div className="mb-16 banner banner-info banner-md">
     We do not check if the image can be loaded, so make sure the image is available!
   </div>
2. If you use the `userid` property (to show a company internal user picture) and a picture is available, this will override the `email` property, as well as `firstname` and `lastname`.<br/><br/>
   <div className="mb-16 banner banner-info banner-md">
     This will only work on `post.ch` urls and only in internal projects.
   </div>
3. If you use the `email` property (to show a users picture provided through gravatar.com) and a picture is available, this will override the `firstname` and `lastname` properties.<br/><br/>
   <div className="mb-16 banner banner-info banner-md">
     Don't know Gravatar or haven't set up a profile yet, let's change this:
     [Signup](https://gravatar.com) now!
   </div>
4. As an overall fallback the `firstname` and `lastname` properties are used to show at least some initials. And as an addition, `firstname` and `lastname` (if defined) are also used on all the other methods to set the `alt` tag of the image (if not already defined).<br/><br/>
   <div className="mb-16 banner banner-info banner-md">
     Because of big differences in the naming convenions around the world, we only set the
     `firstname` as required property.
   </div>

## Check the Content Security Policy

If your project includes the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy">Content-Security-Policy</a> response header (usually in `index.html`),
make sure that `default-src` is set to `'self'`. The `<post-avatar>` component is capable of loading images from gravatar, therefore you need to add [`https://gravatar.com`](https://gravatar.com/) to the `connect-src` in index.html. This is because the component tries to load a profile picture from there, through the provided `email` property.
