  The close button is a web component. It is a slightly adapted version of the icon button, intended
  for a specific use case.
</div>

The value inside the `<post-closebutton>` element will be rendered inside the button as a visually hidden text so make sure to only insert inline content there.

## Usage in other components

When used in other components, the component `<post-closebutton>` will always try to place itself in the predefined slot named `post-closebutton`. This is to simplify the use of the `<post-closebutton>` component, as the other components only have to define the slot with the corresponding name in themselves, without having to define it again on the `<post-closebutton>` component during implementation.

Definition of a component using the `<post-closebutton>` web component:

<Source code={CloseButtonComponentDefinition} language="html" />

Integration of the above defined web component, with the `<post-closebutton>` going directly into its named slot `post-closebutton`.

<Source code={CloseButtonComponentUsage} language="html" />
