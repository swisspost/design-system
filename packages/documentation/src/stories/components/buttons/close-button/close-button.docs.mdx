## Usage in other components

When used in other components, the component `<post-closebutton>` will always try to place itself in the predefined slot named `post-closebutton`. This is to simplify the use of the `<post-closebutton>` component, as the other components only have to define the slot with the corresponding name in themselves, without having to define it again on the `<post-closebutton>` component during implementation.

Definition of a component using the `<post-closebutton>` web component:

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={CloseButtonStories.SlotComponent} />

Integration of the web component, with the post-closebutton going directly into the `name="post-closebutton"` slot defined above.

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={CloseButtonStories.Slot} />
