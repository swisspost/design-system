## Concrete Examples of Application

The following examples show the different characteristics of the component. These can differ in the type of visualization, the html structure, as well as when, how and why they are displayed.

### Full-width

In some situation, it is desirable to display a button using the full available width,
for example when the button is displayed on mobile and stacked vertically with others.

To achieve that, you can use classes in the format:

- `.w-{size}` for the xs breakpoint,
- `.w-{breakpoint}-{size}` for breakpoints from sm to xl.

For example, a button with classes `w-full w-lg-auto` will use all available space only when the viewport size is smaller than `lg`.

To learn more about breakpoints, see the <a href="/?path=/docs/20af6e2b-32b1-42ef-a187-b026aea7fe13--docs">Breakpoints documentation</a>.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.FullWidth} />

### Align buttons

Use flexbox to group and align buttons. As a best practice for keyboard navigation, order the most important button as the first occurrence in a group in the HTML
and use the `.flex-row-reverse`, `.flex-column-reverse`, or `.order-*` classes to change the visual order.

In the following example, the send button appears first on tab navigation.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Align} />
