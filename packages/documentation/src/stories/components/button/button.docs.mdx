## Concrete Examples of Application

The following examples show the different characteristics of the component. These can differ in the type of visualization, the html structure, as well as when, how and why they are displayed.

### Inverted

Inverted buttons don't need special classes anymore, just use any of the
<LinkTo kind="utilities-background" story="docs">background
  classes</LinkTo> to set the background and you're done for the day.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Inverted} />

### Accent colors

There are a number of accent colors that you can apply to buttons instead of the usual colors.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.AccentColors} />

### Contextual colors

Besides the usual and the accent button variations, there are also contextual button colors.

<p className="alert alert-warning">These are only allowed for intranet applications!</p>

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.ContextualColors} />
