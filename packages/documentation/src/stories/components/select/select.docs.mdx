# Select

<p class="lead">
  Customize the native <code>select</code> with CSS that changes the element’s initial appearance.
</p>

Custom `select` menus need only the class `form-select` to trigger the custom styles. Custom styles are limited to the `select`’s initial appearance and cannot modify the `option` elements due to browser limitations.

## Specific examples of application

The following examples show the different characteristics of the component. These can differ in the type of visualization, the html structure, as well as when, how and why they are displayed.

### Selected Option

There are at least two ways to define the selected value in a `select`, but we're only going to show the second variant here, for the sake of simplicity.

- You can define the attribute `value` on the `select` element.
- You can define the attribute `selected` directly on the `option` element.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-form-select--selected-option" />
</Canvas>

### Disabled Options

It is possible to disable individual `option` elements. Disabled options cannot be selected by the user.<br/>
However, it is possible to deactivate the initially selected option as well. This option can then not be reselected after the user changed the selection once.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-form-select--disabled-option" />
</Canvas>

### Floating Label

Wrap a pair of `select` and `label` elements in a `.form-floating` container to enable floating labels.<br/>
But note that the `select` must come first, so we can encure the correct styles.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-form-select--floating-label" />
</Canvas>

### Sizing

The `select` can be used by simply adding one of four classes:

- Small (`form-select-sm`)
- Regular (`form-select-rg`)
- Medium (default or `form-select-md`)
- Large (`form-select-lg`)

<p class="text-danger">
  Note: Do not use this classes on a select-element wrapped within a floating-label container.
</p>

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-form-select--size" />
</Canvas>

### Multiple

Enable multiple select mode by setting the attribute `multiple`, and control how many rows are displayed in the multiple select list-box by setting the `size` attribute to the number of rows to display. Without the `size` attribute, the browser use its default (typically 4).

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-form-select--multiple" />
</Canvas>

### Helper Text

Optional descriptive text which is always shown in a `.form-text` element.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-form-select--helper-text" />
</Canvas>

### Disabled

Add the disabled boolean attribute on a `select` to give it a grayed out appearance and remove pointer events.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-form-select--disabled" />
</Canvas>

### Validation

Simply add the classes `is-valid` or `is-invalid` to the `select` element to show it in the expected state.<br/>
If you like to have some text as feedback, instead of only colors and icons, you can add `.valid-feedback` and `.invalid-feedback` elements after the `select`.
