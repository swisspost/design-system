  We advise opting for the "Standard HTML" approach for when you need full access to the input
  field and using the "Web Component" method in every other case.

    <div className="hide-col-default">
      <Controls of={CardControlStandardHTMLStories.Default} />
    </div>

    ## Examples

    ### Grouping

    Checkbox cards can be grouped together. Use a `fieldset`/`legend` combination to label the group. If there is an error, link the legend with the error message through the `aria-describedby` attribute on the `legend`, pointing to the `id` of the error message.

    <Canvas of={CardControlStandardHTMLStories.Group} />
    <div className="hide-col-default">
      <Controls of={CardControlStandardHTMLStories.Group} />
    </div>

    ### Firefox fallback

    <post-banner>
      Firefox currently does not support{' '} <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:has">the new <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> :has pseudo-selector</a>. As a fallback, the following states have to be mirrored on the top level element in the form of
      classes (see below for a snippet):

      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>checked</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>disabled</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>is-invalid</code>
        </li>
      </ul>

      Check <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-has">caniuse :has()</a> to check if you still need the
      fallback.
    </post-banner>

    This snippet adds a global event listener to mirror the `focused` and `checked` states to the parent of the input. This fallback has to be applied as long as Firefox does not support the `:has` selector.

<Controls of={CardControlStories.Default} />

    ## Installation

    The `<post-card-control>` element is part of the `@swisspost/design-system-components` package. For more information, read the <a href="/?path=/docs/edfb619b-fda1-4570-bf25-20830303d483--docs">getting started with components guide</a>.

    ## Examples

    ### Custom icon

    You can use our built-in icons by just adding the `icon` property with the name of the desired icon.<br/>
    If this is not enough, you can also use the named `icon` slot and add your very own custom icon.

    <post-banner>
      Make sure you remove all the `width` and `height` attributes from the `img` or `svg` tag. Otherwise we can not ensure, our styles will work properly.
    </post-banner>

    <Canvas of={CardControlStories.CustomIcon} />

    ### Custom content

    If you need to add other content to the component, you can use the default slot to do so.

    <post-banner type="warning">
      <p slot="heading">Even if it is generally possible, we do not recommend using interactive elements in this slot because the background of the card control is clickable.</p>
      <p>This can lead to confusion when the hit box of nested interactive controls is not clearly separated from the background, is invalid HTML and click events bubbling up to the card control will unexpectedly toggle it if they're not captured.

    </post-banner>

    <Canvas of={CardControlStories.CustomContent} />

    ### Form Integration

    You can use the component directly in your forms, the control value will be available in the `FormData` of the surrounding `<form>` element, just as you are used to from native input elements.

    <post-banner>
      Update the control and submit or reset the form to see how its FormData value changes.
    </post-banner>
    <Canvas of={CardControlStories.FormIntegration} />
    <div className="hide-col-default">
      <Controls of={CardControlStories.FormIntegration} />
    </div>

    ### Lined up

    Change the `width` of a `<card-control>` component, by putting it (for example) in a grid.
    If you like to stretch all `<card-control>` components within a row to the same `height`, simply add the class `.h-full` to them.

    <Canvas of={CardControlStories.LinedUp} />
    <div className="hide-col-default">
      <Controls of={CardControlStories.LinedUp} />
    </div>

    ### Radio button group

    As you can create radio button groups with native `<radio>` elements, you can do the same with our `<post-card-control>` component as well.<br/>
    Just add the same `name` attribute value to multiple `<post-card-control type="radio">` components.

    <Canvas of={CardControlStories.RadioGroup} />

    ### Custom Trigger
    The `<post-card-control>` offers a `reset` method to reset it to the initial state (`validity` and `checked` state).
    The method can be called directly on the element itself.

    <Source
      code={SampleCardControlMethods}
      language="typescript"
    />
