# Lists

<p className="lead">Use lists to group a collection of related items.</p>

There are three types of HTML lists: unordered lists, ordered lists, and description lists.
Utility classes allow you to style each of these lists in different ways.

## Unordered List

An unordered list groups related items in no specific order or sequence.
It is created using a `<ul>` tag and each list item is preceded by a bullet (small circle).

<Canvas of={ListStories.UnorderedList} sourceState="shown" />

### Unstyled

Remove the default list-style and left margin on list items (immediate children only).
This only applies to immediate child list items, meaning you will need to add the class for any nested lists as well.

### Inline

Remove a list’s bullets and apply some light margin with a combination of two classes,
`.list-inline` and `.list-inline-item`.

<Canvas of={ListStories.InlineList} sourceState="shown" />

## Ordered List

An ordered list groups related items in a specific order.
It is created using a `<ol>` tag and list items are preceded by ascending numbers by default.

<strong>All of the above utility classes also apply to ordered lists.</strong>

## Check List

An unordered list groups related items in no specific order.
It is created using a `<ul>` tag with `list-checks` class. Each list item is preceded with check icon.

<Canvas of={ListStories.CheckList} sourceState="shown" />

## Description List

A description list is a list of terms, with a description of each term.
It is created using a `<dl>` tag, terms are defined using `<dt>` tags, and descriptions are defined using `<dd>` tags.

### Alignment

Align terms and descriptions horizontally by using our grid system’s predefined classes.
For longer terms, you can optionally add a `.text-truncate` class to truncate the text with an ellipsis.
