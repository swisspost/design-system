## Specific examples of application

The following examples show the different characteristics of the component. These can differ in the type of visualization, the html structure, as well as when, how and why they are displayed.

### Variants

For proper styling, use one of the required contextual classes (e.g., `.alert-primary`, `.alert-success`, ...).

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-alert--variant" />
</Canvas>

### Without Icon

Hiding the icon is quite simple, just add the class `.no-icon` to the alert element.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-alert--without-icon" />
</Canvas>

### Custom Icon

It is possible to add a custom icon by adding the class `.pi-{icon}` to the alert element or remove the icon completely.
To get a full list of all available icons visit: [TODO define link](https://design-system.post.ch/#/post-samples/icons).

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-alert--custom-icon" />
</Canvas>

### Additional Content

Alerts can also contain additional HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, dividers, and more.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-alert--additional-content" />
</Canvas>

### Dismissible

Such an alert can be removed from the UI by the user, by clicking on a dismiss button.
This button should normally be inside the alert (as the first child), but you can also use a button which is not included in the alert's HTML.
In the end, it's just a button with an `onClick()` event. As this is a CSS-only component, you have to define the logic yourself.

Dismiss buttons without text should always provide a `dismiss-label` prop, which defines the hidden text associated with the button.

<Canvas withSource>
  <Story id="components-alert--dismissible" />
</Canvas>

### Fixed

A fixed alert (at the bottom of the viewport) is obtained by adding the class `.alert-fixed-bottom` to the alert element.
As this is a CSS-only component, you have to define the logic to show/hide/toggle the alert yourself.
Such an alert is normally also dismissible, so please notice the information for a dismissible alert as well.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-alert--fixed" />
</Canvas>

### Action Buttons

To render an action alert with buttons, the alert element requires an additional class as well as additional HTML content. Thus, everything will be rendered as it should be.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-alert--action-buttons" />
</Canvas>
