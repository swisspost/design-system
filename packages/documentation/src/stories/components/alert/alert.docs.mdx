Alerts are available for any length of text, as well as an optional close button.
By default Alerts will be rendered with a contextually appropriate icon.

## CSS/SCSS Imports

To import the hole design-system-styles package styles:

<Source language="css" dark code={PackageImports} />

To import only the styles required for this component:

<Source language="css" dark code={ComponentImports} />

## Specific examples of application

The following examples show the different characteristics of the component. These can differ in the type of visualization, the html structure, as well as when, how and why they are displayed.

### Variants

For proper styling, use one of the required contextual classes (e.g., .alert-primary, .alert-success, ...).

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-alert--variant" />
</Canvas>

### Icon

It's possible to add a custom icon by adding the class `pi-{icon}` to the alert element or remove the hole icon completley.
To get a full list of all available icons visit: [TODO define link](https://design-system.post.ch/#/post-samples/icons).

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-alert--custom-icon" />
</Canvas>

Hiding the icon is quite simple, just add the class `no-icon` to the alert element.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-alert--without-icon" />
</Canvas>

### Additional Content

Alerts can also contain additional HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, dividers, and more.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-alert--content" />
</Canvas>

### Dismissible Alert

Such an alert can be removed from the UI by the user, by clicking on a dismiss button.
This button should normally be inside of the alert (as first child), but you can also use a buttom which is not included in the alerts html.
At the end, it's just a button with an `onClick` event. As this is a CSS-only component, you have to define the logic by yourself.

Dismiss buttons without text should always provide a `dismiss-label` prop, which defines the hidden text associated with the button.

<Canvas withSource>
  <Story id="components-alert--dismissible" />
</Canvas>

### Fixed Alert

A fixed (to the bottom of the viewport) aligned alert is obtained, by adding the class `alert-fixed-bottom` to the alert element.
As this is a CSS-only component, you have to define the logic by yourself to show/hide/toggle the button.
Such an alert is normally also dismissible, so please note also the informations for a dismissible alert.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-alert--fixed" />
</Canvas>

### Action Buttons

To render an action alert with buttons the elements requires an additional class and also some additional inner html. So everything will be rendered just fine.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-alert--action-buttons" />
</Canvas>
