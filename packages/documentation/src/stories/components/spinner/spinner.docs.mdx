## How to use a live region

Live region should be added at page load and the content should change dynamically.\
See what it means in practice on the [live region section of the accessibility page](/?path=/docs/foundations-accessibility--docs#live-region).

## Examples

### Block interactivity on a section

When a spinner is placed inside an element with a `position-relative` class, it'll block interactivity on all the child elements and will be centered on the content.

<Canvas of={SpinnerStories.BlockSection} />

### Inline on a button

Adding a spinner inside a button allows you to show that an action is processing. Combined with a `disabled` attribute, it indicates to the user to wait for an action to finish and prevents the user to trigger multiple time the action.

<Canvas of={SpinnerStories.Inline} />
