# Accordion

<p className="lead">Toggle the visibility of a set of related content in your project.</p>

The `<post-accordion>` is a container for `<post-collapsible>` components.
It is used to manage how content is shown and hidden within across a set of collapsible elements.

<Canvas of={accordionStories.Default} />
<div className="hide-col-default">
  <Controls of={accordionStories.Default} />
</div>

## Examples

### Single Open Panel

To allow only one panel to be open at a time, simply use the `close-others="true"` property.
In this case, any open panel will be closed every time another panel is opened manually or programmatically.

<Canvas of={accordionStories.CloseOthers} />

### Custom Trigger

The `<post-accordion>` offers several methods to expand or collapse the `<post-collapsible>` it contains.

Expand or collapse all elements at once using `.expandAll()` and `.collapseAll()` respectively,
or toggle just one using `.toggle()` specifying the id of the element you want to act on.
