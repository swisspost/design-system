# Accordion

<p className="lead">Toggle the visibility of a set of related content in your project.</p>

The `<post-accordion>` is a container for `<post-collapsible>` components.
It is used to manage how content is shown and hidden within across a set of collapsible elements.

<Canvas of={accordionStories.Default} />

<Controls of={accordionStories.Default} />

## Examples

### Multiple Open Panels

By default, whenever a panel is opened manually or programmatically, any other open panel is closed.
To allow multiple panels to be open at the same time, simply use the `multiple="true"` property.

<Canvas of={accordionStories.MultipleOpenPanels} />

### Custom Trigger

The `<post-accordion>` offers several methods to expand or collapse the `<post-collapsible>` it contains.

Expand or collapse all elements at once using `.expandAll()` and `.collapseAll()` respectively,
or toggle just one using `.toggle()` specifying the id of the element you want to act on.
