The `<post-accordion>` is a container for `<post-accordion-item>` components.
It is used to manage how content is shown and hidden across a set of collapsible elements.

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={accordionStories.Default} />

## `<post-accordion>`

<Controls of={accordionStories.Default} />

## `<post-accordion-item>`

<Controls of={accordionItemStories.Default} />

## Installation

The `<post-accordion>` element is part of the `@swisspost/design-system-components` package.
For more information, read the [getting started with components guide](/?path=/docs/edfb619b-fda1-4570-bf25-20830303d483--docs).

## Examples

### Multiple Open Panels

By default, whenever a panel is opened manually or programmatically, any other open panel is closed.
To allow multiple panels to be open at the same time, simply use the `multiple="true"` property.

<Canvas of={accordionStories.MultipleOpenPanels} />

### Define default opened panel

By default, the first panel is opened. You can control this behavior by adding the prop `collapsed` to one or multiple `post-accordion-item`.
When adding `collapsed` to the first item, the next item will be opened.

<Canvas of={accordionStories.DefaultCollapsedPanels} />

Multiple items can be opened by default when adding `multiple="true"` property to the `post-accordion` element.

<Canvas of={accordionStories.DefaultCollapsedMultiplePanels} />

### Custom Trigger

The `<post-accordion>` offers several methods to expand or collapse the `<post-accordion-item>` it contains.

Expand or collapse all elements at once using `.expandAll()` and `.collapseAll()` respectively,
or toggle just one using `.toggle()` specifying the id of the element you want to act on.
