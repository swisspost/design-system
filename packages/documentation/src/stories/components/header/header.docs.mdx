The Header adapts to your needs and can contain a variety of sub-components depending on your use case.

It is divided into two sections:

1. **Global Header** (Yellow Background): provides navigation links and information that are global to the entire organization.
2. **Application Header** (White Background): displays navigation links and information specific to the current application.

## Installation

The `<post-header>` element is part of the `@swisspost/design-system-components` package.
For more information, read the [getting started with components guide](/?path=/docs/edfb619b-fda1-4570-bf25-20830303d483--docs).

<StylesPackageImport components={['header', 'list', 'button']} />

### CSS Properties

The `<post-header>` styles expose several custom properties on the `:root` element:

- `--post-header-height`: the current visible height of the header
- `--post-header-expanded-height`: the height of the header when expanded
- `--post-header-reduced-height`: the height of the header when reduced

In addition, the `<post-header>` styles set the `scroll-padding-top` property on the `<body>` element to match the currently visible header height.
This ensures that when using scroll navigation (e.g. jumping to anchors), content is positioned correctly below the header.

## Active Navigation Items

**The `aria-current="page"` attribute highlights the active navigation items**

This attribute is not added automatically,
it must be applied by your application logic to the `<a>` element of the `<post-mainnavigation>` that represents the page currently being viewed.
Once applied, parent items in the navigation automatically inherit the correct selected styling.

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={HeaderStories.ActiveNavigationItem} />

## Examples

### Post Portal

The Header for the Post Portal (post.ch) is a consistently available interface element that provides a consistent navigation experience across the whole Post Portal and other portals.

It not only contains globally available key elements (such as Language), it also provides a first content selection via the target group buttons. They define the further navigation.

<Canvas of={HeaderStories.Portal} inline="false" />

### Microsite

The Microsite Header is a consistently available interface element that provides a consistent navigation experience across the whole Microsite.

<Canvas of={HeaderStories.Microsite} inline="false" />

### One Pager

The One Pager Header is a consistently available interface element that provides a consistent navigation experience across the whole One Pager.

<Canvas of={HeaderStories.OnePager} inline="false" />
