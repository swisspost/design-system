  The App Store Badge component is used to display badges for app promotion, providing variants for both Google Play and Apple App Stores.

<Canvas of={AppStoreBadgeStories.Default} sourceState="shown" controls={['store', 'language']} />

Projects provide and host the images for the badges locally to ensure they remain up-to-date. Additionally, the alt attribute and the span text should be adjusted according to the store (Apple Store/Google play) and language.
