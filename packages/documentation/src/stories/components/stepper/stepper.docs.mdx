## Examples

### Navigational Stepper

You can use a stepper to allow users to navigate to specific steps.
To do so, use `a` elements for the `.stepper-link` of the steps you want to be navigable, and use `span` for the steps you want not to be navigable.
Then, wrap the stepper inside a `<nav>`.

However, it is better not to use an `a` for the current step since the user is already on the page.

### Informational Stepper

If you wish to display the stepper for informational purposes only, you can use `<span>` elements for the `.stepper-link` on all the steps.
In this case, there's no need to wrap the stepper inside a `<nav>`.

<Canvas of={StepperStories.InformationalStepper} />

### Long Labels

When dealing with longer labels that may wrap into multiple lines, it is recommended to use a `title` attribute for the `.stepper-link`.
This will truncate the label with an ellipsis if it exceeds two lines, while allowing the user to read the full label by hovering over it with the mouse.
