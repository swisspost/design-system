```

## Concrete Examples of Application

The following examples show the different characteristics of the component. These can differ in the type of visualization, the html structure, as well as when, how and why they are displayed.

### Checkable

A checkable `.badge` is nothing else than a custom-checkbox. Therefore you can manipulate it like every default `checkbox` element.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-badge--checkable" />
</Canvas>

### Dismissible

A dismissible `.badge` can be removed from the UI by the user, by clicking on the close button.
Close buttons without text should always provide a `dismiss-label` prop, which defines the hidden text associated with the button.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-badge--dismissible" />
</Canvas>
