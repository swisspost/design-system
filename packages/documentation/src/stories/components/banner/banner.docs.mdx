  A banner shows general notifications for a product or system, not a specific task and should therefore not require the user to take immediate action. Banners can persist across multiple sessions.

## Examples

### Contents

Banners can contain various HTML elements like paragraphs, lists, icons and dividers.

By default all children of the `<post-banner>` are placed in the body.
Use the `heading` slot to place a child in the heading, and the `actions` slot for action buttons.

<Canvas of={BannerStories.Contents} />

### Dismissal

The `dismissible` property can be set to enable users to dismiss the banner.
When present, it specifies that the banner should contain a dismiss button,
and you must provide a label for this button using the `dismiss-label` property.
Although the label remains hidden from view, it is essential for ensuring accessibility for users of assistive technologies.

<Canvas of={BannerStories.Dismissible} />

Alternatively, you can use any button, including action buttons within the banner, as a trigger for dismissing the banner using the `.dismiss()` method.
This method operates asynchronously and returns a promise that resolves once the fade-out animation has finished.
