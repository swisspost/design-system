# Button Group

<div className="lead">
  Group a series of buttons together on a single line.
</div>

  <Controls of={ButtonGroupStories.Default} />
</div>

## Concrete Examples of Application

The following examples show the different characteristics of the component. These can differ in the type of visualization, the html structure, as well as when, how and why they are displayed.

### Sizing

You can change the size of buttons belonging to a group using button-sizing classes: `.btn-sm`, `.btn-rg` and `.btn-lg`.
Just be sure to apply the same class to all buttons contained in the group.

<Canvas of={ButtonGroupStories.Sizing} />

### Checkbox & Radio

Any HTML element that can be styled as a button can potentially be used in a button group.
It is also possible to use checkable inputs:

- Checkboxes: this allows all buttons in the group to be selected or deselected individually,
- Radio buttons: in this case all the buttons are linked and only one of them can be selected at a time.
