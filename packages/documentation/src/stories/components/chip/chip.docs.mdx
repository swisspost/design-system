  Chips contain small labels which represent single values or a collection of values. These discrete
  pieces of information can be inputs, status, properties, categories or any other pieces of meta
  data.

## Examples

### Selectable Chip

Selectable chips typically contain product-authored information and are used to select, filter or categorize elements.
They are personalized checkboxes, allowing users to toggle them to filter content effectively.

A group of selectable chips need to be contained within a `.chip-selectable-group` div.

Alternatively, selectable chips may be used with radio inputs when a single filter selection is needed.

Selectable chips can contain a number badge which indicates the number of items matching with the respective label.

### Dismissible Chip

Dismissible chips typically contain user-authored information and do not provide any additional action next to “Dismiss”. They are always accompanied with an input component which generates them.

It's important to note that the close icon lacks visible text.
Therefore, it's imperative to include a visually hidden label to ensure accessibility for users relying on assistive technologies.

A group of dismissible chips need to be contained within a `.chip-dismissible-group` div.
