## Examples

### Selectable Chip

Selectable chips typically contain product-authored information and are used to select, filter or categorize elements.
They are personalized checkboxes, allowing users to toggle them to filter content effectively.

A group of selectable chips need to be contained within a `.chip-selectable-group` div.

<Canvas of={ChipStories.SelectableCheckboxChip} />

Alternatively, selectable chips may be used with radio inputs when a single filter selection is needed.

<Canvas of={ChipStories.SelectableRadioChip} />

Selectable chips can contain a number badge which indicates the number of items matching with the respective label.

<Canvas of={ChipStories.SelectableBadgeChip} />

### Dismissible Chip

Dismissible chips typically contain user-authored information and do not provide any additional action next to “Dismiss”.

It's important to note that the close icon lacks visible text.
Therefore, it's imperative to include a visually hidden label to ensure accessibility for users relying on assistive technologies.

A group of dismissible chips need to be contained within a `.chip-dismissible-group` div.
