## Examples

### Filter Chip

Filter chips provide a simple means to refine content or search results based on specific attributes.
They are personalized checkboxes, allowing users to toggle them to filter content effectively.

Alternatively, filter chips may be used with radio inputs when a single filter selection is needed.

### Dismissible Chip

Dismissible chips represent pieces of information entered by a user.
Each chip includes a close button, enabling users to conveniently remove them from view.

It's important to note that the close icon lacks visible text.
Therefore, it's imperative to include a visually hidden label to ensure accessibility for users relying on assistive technologies.
