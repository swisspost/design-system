# Teaser Card

<p className="lead">
  A teaser card is a clickable preview that leads to detailed content, providing a convenient entry
  point for users to access more information. It contains maximum one interactive element (button)
  which links to the same location as the card.{' '}

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={TeaserStories.Default} />
