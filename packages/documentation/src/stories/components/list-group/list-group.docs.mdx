## Types of lists

### List Links

The links list collects and displays a set of links. It is therefore a navigational element which leads the user to other locations.

To have the animation on the arrow, don't forget to add the class `.list-group-item-action` on each `li` item as well as `.list-group-item-right-svg` on the icon to animate.

### List Documents

The documents list collects and displays a set of documents. It does not only help users find a specific item, but also provides the user with a button to download the respective document.

Do not add the animation class to the list items as it would not make sense with the download icon.

### List Switch

The switches list collects and displays a set of switches. It does not only help users find a specific item, but also provides the functionality to select and unselect list items.
