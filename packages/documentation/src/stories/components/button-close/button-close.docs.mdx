  The close button is a web component. It is a slightly adapted version of the icon button, intended
  for a specific use case.
</div>

The value inside the `<post-closebutton>` element will be rendered inside the button as a visually hidden text so make sure to only insert inline content there.

### Automatic Positioning

By default, the `post-closebutton` positions itself automatically.
This means the component applies its own positioning styles to place the button at the top-right corner of the element it closes.

**Important:** for this to work as expected, the closable element must provide a positioning context.
You must therefore add positioning styles to the closable element (for example by applying the `.position-relative` class).

In case the space available around the closable element is not sufficient fit the close button with it's default position,
you can use the `position="manual"`.
It will then not be positioned at all, appearing as any other button, and you can add custom styles to place it wherever needed.

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={CloseButtonStories.AutomaticPositioning} />

### Manual Positioning

If the available space around the closable element is insufficient for the default automatic positioning,
you can switch to manual positioning utsing the `position="manual"` property.

When `position="manual"` is used, no positioning styles are applied by the component.
The button is rendered inline like a regular button, and you are responsible for providing any styles needed to place it.
