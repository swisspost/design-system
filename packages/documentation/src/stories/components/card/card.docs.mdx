<div className="lead">Cards provide a flexible and extensible content container.</div>

Built with flexbox, they offer easy alignment and mix well with other components.

They have no fixed width to start, so they’ll naturally fill the full width of their parent element.
This is easily customizable using the grid for example. For more details on that, read our [grid docs](/?path=/docs/7240f2ef-216a-490e-9bd8-c0cef19f7b31--docs).

## Interactivity

Card elements can contain many things, they can be interactive or not.
Interactive cards have a shadow and an hover effect.

To make your card interactive, simply use a `post-linkarea` component as container.
To know more about it, read our [post-linkarea documentation](/?path=/docs/1d52b794-768b-464e-90eb-4fd15774aa90--docs).

  Interactive cards must include exactly one anchor element.

  Cards that require more than one link should use a non-interactive card, which allows a broader range of interactive elements.

## Hidden Link

For accessibility, an interactive card must always contain a link so it can be discovered by screen readers.
The link may be visually hidden so it does not appear within the card.
