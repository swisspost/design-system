  Cards provide a flexible and extensible content container with multiple variants and options.
</div>

Built with flexbox, they offer easy alignment and mix well with other components.

They have no fixed width to start, so theyâ€™ll naturally fill the full width of its parent element.
This is easily customizable using the grid for example. For more details on that, read our [grid docs](/?path=/docs/7240f2ef-216a-490e-9bd8-c0cef19f7b31--docs).

## Foundations

Card elements can contain many things, they can be interactive or not. Interactive cards will have a shadow and an hover effect. To make your card interactive, simply add the `post-linkarea` component around it.
To read more about it, read our [post-linkarea docs](/?path=/docs/1d52b794-768b-464e-90eb-4fd15774aa90--docs).

<div className="banner banner-info">
  Do not place more than one interactive element on an interactive card. If your card should contain
  more than one action, consider using a non-interactive card which can contain multiple different
  actionable/interactive elements.
</div>

## Examples

### Palettes

Cards should never be the same color as its section's background. Therefore, depending on the palette, the card's background color will adapt.

<Canvas sourceState="hidden" of={CardStories.Palette} />

### Custom Content

Cards support a wide variety of content, including images, text, links, and more.
This applies to the body of the card as well as its header and footer.

<Canvas of={CardStories.CustomContent} />

### List Group

Create lists of content in a card by simply using a flush list group in place of the card body.

<Canvas of={CardStories.ListGroup} />

### Bad example

<div className="banner banner-danger mb-16">
  Never use text with a background image because you can't ensure it is readable by everyone for all
  languages and browser sizes.
</div>

<Canvas of={CardStories.BackgroundImage} />
