  Cards provide a flexible and extensible content container with multiple variants and options.
</div>

Built with flexbox, they offer easy alignment and mix well with other components.

They have no fixed width to start, so they’ll naturally fill the full width of its parent element.
This is easily customizable using the grid for example. For more details on that, read our [grid docs](/?path=/docs/7240f2ef-216a-490e-9bd8-c0cef19f7b31--docs).

## Foundations

Card elements can contain many things, they can be interactive or not. Cards containing a link or a button are considered interactive and will have a shadow instead of simple border. To force a card to be interactive, the class `.interactive-card` may also be used.

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={CardStories.Default} />

### Nested cards

A card that is nested within another card will have a smaller border-radius than its parent.

<Canvas sourceState="false" of={CardStories.NestedCard} />

<StylesPackageImport components={['card']} />

## Examples

### Basic Content

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={CardStories.BasicContent} />
<div className="hide-col-default">
  <Controls of={CardStories.BasicContent} />
</div>

### Custom Content

Cards support a wide variety of content, including images, text, links, and more.
This applies to the body of the card as well as its header and footer.

<Canvas of={CardStories.CustomContent} />

### List Group

Create lists of content in a card by simply using a flush list group in place of the card body.

<Canvas of={CardStories.ListGroup} />

### Card Group

Use card groups to render cards as a single, attached element with equal width and height columns.

<Canvas of={CardStories.CardGroup} />

### Bad example

<div className="banner banner-danger mb-16">
  Never use text with a background image because you can't ensure it is readable by everyone for all
  languages and browser sizes.
</div>

<Canvas of={CardStories.BackgroundImage} />
