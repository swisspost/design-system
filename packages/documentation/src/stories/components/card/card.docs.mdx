# Card

<div className="lead">
  Cards provide a flexible and extensible content container with multiple variants and options.
</div>

Built with flexbox, they offer easy alignment and mix well with other components.

They have no fixed width to start, so theyâ€™ll naturally fill the full width of its parent element.
This is easily customizable using the grid for example,

<div className="hide-col-default">
  <Controls of={CardStories.Default} />
</div>

```scss
@use '@swisspost/design-system-styles/index.scss';
```

@use '@swisspost/design-system-styles/components/card.scss';
```

## Examples

### Custom Content

Cards support a wide variety of content, including images, text, links, and more.
This applies to the body of the card as well as its header and footer.

<Canvas of={CardStories.CustomContent} />

### List Group

Create lists of content in a card by simply using a flush list group in place of the card body.

<Canvas of={CardStories.ListGroup} />

### Card Group

Use card groups to render cards as a single, attached element with equal width and height columns.

<Canvas of={CardStories.CardGroup} />

### Bad example

<div className="alert alert-danger mb-3">
  Never use text with a background image because you can't ensure it is readable by everyone for all languages and browser sizes.
</div>

<Canvas of={CardStories.BackgroundImage} />
