  Cards provide a flexible and extensible content container with multiple variants and options.
</div>

Built with flexbox, they offer easy alignment and mix well with other components.

They have no fixed width to start, so theyâ€™ll naturally fill the full width of its parent element.
This is easily customizable using the grid for example. For more details on that, read our [grid docs](/?path=/docs/7240f2ef-216a-490e-9bd8-c0cef19f7b31--docs).

## Foundations

Card elements can contain many things, they can be interactive or not. Interactive cards will have a shadow and an hover effect. To make your card interactive, simply add the `.interactive-card` class on it.
The `.interactive-card` will take the first `a` or `button` tag and make it so that clicking on the card will click on that interactive element.

## Examples

### Palettes

Cards should never be the same color as its section's background. Therefore, depending on the palette, the card's background color will adapt.

<Canvas sourceState="hidden" of={CardStories.Palette} />

### Basic Content

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={CardStories.BasicContent} />
<div className="hide-col-default">
  <Controls of={CardStories.BasicContent} />
</div>

### Custom Content

Cards support a wide variety of content, including images, text, links, and more.
This applies to the body of the card as well as its header and footer.

<Canvas of={CardStories.CustomContent} />

### List Group

Create lists of content in a card by simply using a flush list group in place of the card body.

<Canvas of={CardStories.ListGroup} />

### Card Group

Use card groups to render cards as a single, attached element with equal width and height columns.

<Canvas of={CardStories.CardGroup} />

### Bad example

<div className="banner banner-danger mb-16">
  Never use text with a background image because you can't ensure it is readable by everyone for all
  languages and browser sizes.
</div>

<Canvas of={CardStories.BackgroundImage} />
