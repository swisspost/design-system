Built with flexbox, they offer easy alignment and mix well with other components.

They have no fixed width to start, so they’ll naturally fill the full width of their parent element.
This is easily customizable using the grid for example. For more details on that, read our [grid docs](/?path=/docs/7240f2ef-216a-490e-9bd8-c0cef19f7b31--docs).

## Interactivity

Card elements can contain many things, they can be interactive or not. Interactive cards will have a shadow and an hover effect. To make your card interactive, simply add the `post-linkarea` component around it.
To read more about it, read our [post-linkarea docs](/?path=/docs/1d52b794-768b-464e-90eb-4fd15774aa90--docs).

  Do not place more than one interactive element on an interactive card. If your card should contain
  more than one action, consider using a non-interactive card which can contain multiple different
  actionable/interactive elements.
