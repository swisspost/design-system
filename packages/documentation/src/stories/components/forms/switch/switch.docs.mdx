# Switch

<div className="lead">
  A switch has the markup of a custom <code>&lt;input type="checkbox"/&gt;</code> but uses the{' '}
  <code>.form-switch</code> class to render a toggle switch.
</div>

Consider using `role="switch"` to more accurately convey the nature of the control to assistive technologies that support this role. In older assistive technologies, it will simply be announced as a regular `checkbox` as a fallback. Switches also support the `disabled` attribute.

<div className="hide-col-default">
  <Controls of={switchStories.Default} />
</div>

<StylesPackageImport components={["form-check"]} required={{ 'form-feedback': true }} />

## Concrete Examples of Application

The following examples show the different characteristics of the component. These can differ in the type of visualization, the HTML structure, as well as when, how and why they are displayed.

### Multiline Labels

Long labels can be used seamlessly and are automatically wrapped at the end of the line.
You can also include inline elements into the label, such as `<a>`, `<strong>`, etc.<br/>
However, make sure to always place multiline labels after the `checkbox`.

<Canvas of={switchStories.MultilineLabels} />

### Validation

Simply add the classes `.is-valid` or `.is-invalid` to the `switch` element to show it in the expected state.<br/>
When the component has been validated, don't forget to add a `<p className="valid-feedback">...</p>` or `<p className="invalid-feedback">...</p>` element after the `switch` element to explain what went wrong. This enables the user to correct the mistake.
