# Select

<div className="lead">
  Customize the native `<select>` with CSS that changes the element’s initial appearance.
</div>

Custom `<select>` menus need only the class `.form-select` to trigger the custom styles. Custom styles are limited to the `<select>`’s initial appearance and cannot modify the `<option>` elements due to browser limitations.

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={SelectStories.Default} />
<div className="hide-col-default">
  <Controls of={SelectStories.Default} />
</div>

<StylesPackageImport components={["forms", "form-select"]}
                     required={{ 'floating-label': true, 'form-feedback': true }} />

## Concrete Examples of Application

The following examples show the different characteristics of the component. These can differ in the type of visualization, the HTML structure, as well as when, how and why they are displayed.

### Floating Label

Wrap a pair of `<select>` and `<label>` elements in a `.form-floating` container to enable floating labels.<br/>
But note that the `<select>` must come first, so we can ensure the correct styles.

<Canvas of={SelectStories.FloatingLabel} />

#### With label as a placeholder

If you use an empty option in your select and you want that your label acts as placeholder,
you can dynamically add the class `.form-select-empty` to the `<select>` when there are no value defined or no option selected.

<Canvas of={SelectStories.FloatingLabelPlaceholder} />

### Sizing

<div className="alert alert-warning">
  <h4 className="alert-heading">We're deprecating the regular and medium sizes for text input, textarea and select.</h4>
  <p className="mt-0">This will make it easier to select the appropriate size variant: small for internal applications, large for external applications.<br />`.form-select-rg` and `.form-select-md` are deprecated and will be removed in the next major version.</p>
</div>

The size can be adjusted, by simply adding one of the following four classes:

- Small: `.form-select-sm`
- Regular: `.form-select-rg`
- Medium: default or `.form-select-md`
- Large: `.form-select-lg`

<div className="alert alert-info alert-md">
  Regular and medium size classes are not available on floating-label elements
</div>

<Canvas of={SelectStories.Size} />

### Validation

Simply add the classes `is-valid` or `is-invalid` to the `<select>` element to show it in the expected state.<br/>
When the component has been validated, don't forget to add a `<p className="valid-feedback">...</p>` or `<p className="invalid-feedback">...</p>` element after the `select` element to explain what went wrong. This enables the user to correct the mistake.

<Canvas of={SelectStories.Validation} />
