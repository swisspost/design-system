This page describes the typography basics of the design system.<br/>
If you want to know how to adjust font-families, font-sizes, etc. in your code,
please visit our [text utilities docs](/?path=/docs/c55681df-4d21-469d-a5b3-c67686e7c104--docs).

## Font Family

The main font family is "Swiss Post Sans".<br/>
It is available in three different font weights: black, bold and regular.

<FontFaceWrapper>
  <FontFace face="Swiss Post Sans" family="sans-serif" weight="black" style="normal" />
  <FontFace face="Swiss Post Sans" family="sans-serif" weight="bold" style="normal" />
  <FontFace face="Swiss Post Sans" family="sans-serif" weight="regular" style="normal" />
</FontFaceWrapper>

### Standalone usage

If you cannot use the design system but need the fonts, you can integrate them into your project as follows:

<Source code={SampleStandalone} language="css" />

The CSS file including these @font-face definitions is available on our CDN under the following URL:

<Source code="https://fonts.post.ch/swiss-post-sans/v1/swiss-post-sans.css" />

## Font Sizes & Line Heights

### Base Font Size

The default font size is `16px`. This corresponds to the CSS value of `1rem`. Users are able to change the default font size in their browser. By using `rem`, the font-sizes scale nicely with the user defined value.

The line height depends on the font size and is specified with a multiplying factor. This multiplication factor decreases as the font size increases.

Font sizes variants are available in the [text utilities](/?path=/docs/c55681df-4d21-469d-a5b3-c67686e7c104--docs).

## Elements

The following sections show what specific elements look like.

### Headings

All HTML headings are available, from `h1` the highest section level to `h6` the lowest.<br/>
If you need to match the font styling of a heading but cannot use the associated HTML element,
use the override classes.

<Canvas of={TypographyStories.Heading} sourceState="shown" />

Sometimes the document heading structure requires you
to use a heading tag that should look like another in order to maintain a consistency.
In those cases you can use the heading helper classes `.h1` through `.h6`.<br/>

### Paragraphs

<Canvas of={TypographyStories.Paragraph} sourceState="shown" />

A lead provides the reader with a summary of the most important information about the subsequent paragraph or content. A paragraph is a group of sentences which belong to the same context.

### Links

Use links to navigate users to another location, such as a different site, resource, or section within the same page.

<post-banner>
  The examples below are dummy links for visual demonstration only — they do not navigate anywhere.
</post-banner>

<Canvas of={TypographyStories.Link} sourceState="shown" />

### Inline Elements

<Canvas of={TypographyStories.Inline} sourceState="shown" />

### Legends

A legend is in general the title of a group of related (interactive) elements in a form. Not to be confused with caption.

<Canvas of={TypographyStories.Legend} sourceState="shown" />

<StylesPackageImport
  components={['lead']}
  importText="To import only the styles required for typography elements:"
/>
