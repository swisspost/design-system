import { Canvas, Meta, Controls } from '@storybook/addon-docs/blocks';
import meta, * as SectionStories from './sections.stories';
import PackageTag from '@/shared/package-tag';

<Meta of={SectionStories} />

<PackageTag meta={meta}/>

<div className="lead">
The `.section` class is used to create a container that ensures content does not exceed a maximum width of 1920px (Full HD), providing a consistent layout across different screen sizes.
</div>

<post-banner>
  To see this component in action, you actually need a screen with a resolution bigger than Full HD.
</post-banner>

The component does not add any paddings, so make sure you're using a `.container` element along with some of our [spacing utility classes](/?path=/docs/facaacfd-18f1-49b4-80f1-a96680730fa0--docs) inside to ensure your content gets padded correctly across all viewports.

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={SectionStories.Default}/>

In the example above, the `.section` class is making sure, the background-colored container will not be any wider than Full HD, while the inner `.container` class is making sure content itself keeps aliged with the rest of the pages content.

## Edge alignment

Inside the `.section` element you can use some helper classes to align elements either with the edges of the `.section` or the `.container` element.

<Canvas of={SectionStories.Alignment}/>
<div className="hide-col-default">
  <Controls of={SectionStories.Alignment}/>
</div>
