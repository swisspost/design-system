# Containers

<div className="lead">
  Containers are essential layout elements ensuring content is aligned and properly padded across all devices and viewports.

There are two types of containers. The only difference between them is how they behave on wider screens.
To see the difference, click the **"View full screen"** button in the examples below.

## Container

The `.container` adapts its width based on the viewport size, but it will not exceed 1200px.
This ensures content stays centered and does not stretch too wide on large screens.

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={ContainerStories.Container} />

## Fluid Container

The `.container-fluid` spans the entire width of the viewport, regardless of its size.
Use this for layouts where the content should stretch edge-to-edge, even on large screens.

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={ContainerStories.ContainerFluid} />
