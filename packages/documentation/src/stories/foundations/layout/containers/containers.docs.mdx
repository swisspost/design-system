There are two types of containers. The only difference between them is how they behave on wider screens.
To see the difference, click the **"View full screen"** button in the examples below.

## Container

The `.container` adapts its width based on the viewport size, but it will not exceed 1200px.
This ensures content stays centered and does not stretch too wide on large screens.

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={ContainerStories.Container} />

## Fluid Container

The `.container-fluid` spans the entire width of the viewport, regardless of its size.
Use this for layouts where the content should stretch edge-to-edge, even on large screens.

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={ContainerStories.ContainerFluid} />
