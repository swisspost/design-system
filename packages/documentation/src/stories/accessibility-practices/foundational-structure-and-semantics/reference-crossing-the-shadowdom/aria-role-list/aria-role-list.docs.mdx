# role="list"

<div className="lead">
  The `role="list"` tells assistive technologies that an element represents a list, which is
  expected to contain related items identified with `role="listitem"`.
</div>

### I. Parent and Children Within the Same DOM Tree

• <b>Both parent and children in Light DOM</b> ✔️

<Source language="html" dark code={DefaultExample}></Source>

<Canvas of={CCR.ExampleHTML} sourceState="hide" />

<p>
  This represents the default structure, where a `role="list"` element contains direct children with
  `role="listitem"`.
</p>

• <b>Parent and children in the same Shadow DOM</b> ✔️

<Source language="html" dark code={DefaultExample2}></Source>

<Canvas of={CCR.Example1a} sourceState="hide" />

<p>
  Same as above, but contained within a custom component’s Shadow DOM. The `role="list"` still has
  direct `role="listitem"` children, so the structure remains valid.
</p>

• <b>Parent on the host with slotted children</b> ✔️

<Source language="html" dark code={DefaultExample3}></Source>

<Canvas of={CCR.Example1b} sourceState="hide" />

<p>
  Similarly, in the case of a component with `role="list"` set on the host and slotted `listitems`,
  the relationship is preserved correctly.
</p>

### II. Parent in the Light DOM-children Into The Shadow DOM

• <b>Parent in the light DOM and children in the ShadowDOM</b> ✔️

<Source language="html" dark code={WorkingExampleIIa}></Source>

<Canvas of={CCR.Example2a} sourceState="hide" />

<p>
  In the case a component with `role="list"` in the host with `listitem` elements within its Shadow
  DOM, the relationship is valid.
</p>

• <b>Slotted parent and children in the ShadowDOM</b> ❌

<Source language="html" dark code={WorkingExampleIIb}></Source>
<Canvas of={CCR.Example2b} sourceState="hide" />

<p>
  ⚠️ The above structure does not comply with accessibility standards, as `listitems` must be
  children of an element with `role="list"`. The relationship fails not because of the Shadow DOM
  boundary, but due to the incorrect structure itself.
</p>

### III. Parent in the Shadow DOM - Children Out to the Light DOM

• <b>Parent in the Shadow DOM and children in the Light DOM</b> ❌

<Source language="html" dark code={WorkingExampleIIIa}></Source>

<p>
  ⚠️ The above structure does not comply with accessibility standards, as `listitems` must be
  children of an element with `role="list"`. The relationship fails not because of the Shadow DOM
  boundary, but due to the incorrect structure itself.
</p>

• <b>Parent in the Shadow DOM with slotted children </b> ✔️

<Source language="html" dark code={WorkingExampleIIIb}></Source>

<Canvas of={CCR.Example3b} sourceState="hide" />

<p>
  When a component applies `role="list"` to an internal element and its children with
  `role="listitem"` are slotted into that element, the structure still works correctly and preserves
  a valid `list/listitem` relationship.
</p>

### IV. Referencing From One ShadowDOM To Another ShadowDOM

• <b>Parent in the Shadow DOM - Children grouped in a nested Component</b> ✔️

<Source language="html" dark code={WorkingExampleIVa}></Source>

<Canvas of={CCR.Example4a} sourceState="shown" />

<p>
  This structure works correctly: the parent `role="list"` maintains a valid relationship with its
  children, even when the `listitem` elements are grouped inside a nested component.
</p>

• <b>Parent in the Shadow DOM - Slotted Children as individual Components</b> ✔️

<Source language="html" dark code={WorkingExampleIVb}></Source>

<Canvas of={CCR.Example4b} sourceState="hide" />
<p>
  In this case the `listitem` elements are slotted and encapsulated within individual custom
  components. This structure also forms a valid `list-listitem` relationship.
</p>

• <b>Parent in the Shadow DOM - nested Grouping Component -> nested Children individual components</b> ✔️

<Source language="html" dark code={WorkingExampleIVc}></Source>

<Canvas of={CCR.Example4c} sourceState="hide" />

<p>
  In the case of a `role="list"` parent containing a grouping component, with individual `listitem`
  children nested inside their own components, the relationship is still correctly preserved across
  two Shadow DOM boundaries.
</p>

## Conclusion: Shadow DOM and List Semantics

<p>
  When the markup is properly structured such that elements with `role="listitem"` exist within a
  parent element having `role="list"`, the presence of Shadow DOM does not break the semantic
  `list/listitem` relationship—even across multiple component boundaries. The `listitems` do not
  necessarily have to be direct children of the `role="list"` element for the relationship to be
  preserved, as the accessibility tree will bridge through the encapsulation when the markup is
  correct.
