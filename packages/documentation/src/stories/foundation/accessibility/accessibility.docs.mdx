## Forms

### Disabled state

Disabled states of input fields or buttons pose many accessibility issues.

<ul class="list-unstyled ms-regular">
  <div class="d-flex gap-mini"><div>❌</div><li>Disabled fields cannot be reached by pressing tab</li></div>
  <div class="d-flex gap-mini"><div>❌</div><li>It's often unclear why something is disabled</li></div>
  <div class="d-flex gap-mini"><div>❌</div><li>It's often unclear how to enable a disabled field or button</li></div>
  <div class="d-flex gap-mini"><div>❌</div><li>Disabled fields have low contrast</li></div>
  <div class="d-flex gap-mini"><div>❌</div><li>The disabled state of a field is not always obvious (hard to discern from an enabled field)</li></div>
</ul>

        <td>
          <ul class="list-unstyled d-flex gap-mini">
            <div>❌</div><li>Forms with required fields tend to have the send button disabled until all required fields are correctly filled. The issue here is that with long forms or on small devices it's sometimes hard to spot the one field that was missed.</li>

        </td>
        <td>
          <ul class="list-unstyled d-flex gap-mini">
            <div>✔️</div><li>Provide a loading indicator or display a message that shows current progress when uploading large files. Disable duplicate form submissions internally by either aborting the current request and sending a new one or supressing new submissions during loading. Offer a remedy if the request timed out or an error occurred on the server (reload the page, retry form submission, ...).</li>
          </ul>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td colSpan="2" class="fw-bold">Disabled select options</td>

        <td>
          <ul class="list-unstyled d-flex gap-mini">
            <div>❌</div><li>Some options in a radio button group or select field are disabled because they are not available at this time or with the current configuration. This can be confusing because it's often unclear why these options are not available or how to enable them.</li>
          </ul>

        <td>
          <ul class="list-unstyled d-flex gap-mini">
            <div>✔️</div>
            <li>
            There are multiple possible solutions, depending on the situation:
              <ul>
                <li>Don't display options that cannot be selected and reduce clutter in your UI.</li>
                <li>If you need to inform the user that there are potentially more possible options, show instructions on how to enable these options.</li>
                <li>Display read-only data as text and not in disabled form fields.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

## Live region

A live region allows you to notify the user about a dynamic change without requiring the page to reload e.g. alert, loading status, chat logs, update of a product cart, feeds, etc.

They are defined either by using the `aria-live` attribute or some specific `role` attributes such as `role=status`, `role=alert`, `role=log`, etc.

### Implicit aria-live attribute with role attribute

`role=status`, `role=log` and `role=alert` have an implicit default `aria-live` attribute, however for a maximum compatibility, it is recommended to add it as well (except for `role=alert`). Source: [Roles with implicit live region attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions#roles_with_implicit_live_region_attributes)

### Choose the appropriate value for the aria-live attribute

`aria-live` attribute can be either:
* `polite`: message will be announced after the screen reader is idle.
* `assertive`: message will interrupt any announcement immediately. It should be used sparingly.

### Announce the whole Live region on change

By default, screen readers will only announce the part that changed. However, it's often better to repeat the context of the change.
To do so, we can add `aria-atomic=true` attribute on the live region. This attribute force screen readers to read the whole text.

For example on a shopping website, you want to announce to the user that a product was added to the shopping basket. If you announce only the product name, it's not enough to be comprehensive.

<Source code={liveRegionAtomicSample} language="html" />

### Add or remove dynamically a live region

As a best practice, live region should be present on the page load and only the content inside it should change.

#### Example with a spinner on Angular

When adding, for example, a spinner above a section, the live region container should be rendered initially while you can use `ng-container` to show and hide the spinner when you need it.

##### Good example

<Source code={liveRegionGoodAngularSample} language="html" />

##### Bad example

You shouldn't add the whole region dynamically as the accessibility bindings might not be [updated with some screen readers](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2022/02/05/are-we-live.html#non-normative-rule-for-common-live-region-use-case).
