# Forms

## Disabled state

Disabled states of input fields or buttons pose many accessibility issues.

<ul class="list-unstyled ms-regular">
  <div class="d-flex gap-mini"><div>❌</div><li>Disabled fields cannot be reached by pressing tab</li></div>
  <div class="d-flex gap-mini"><div>❌</div><li>It's often unclear why something is disabled</li></div>
  <div class="d-flex gap-mini"><div>❌</div><li>It's often unclear how to enable a disabled field or button</li></div>
  <div class="d-flex gap-mini"><div>❌</div><li>Disabled fields have low contrast</li></div>
  <div class="d-flex gap-mini"><div>❌</div><li>The disabled state of a field is not always obvious (hard to discern from an enabled field)</li></div>
</ul>

    <colgroup>

      <col style={{width: '50%'}} />

    <tbody>

      <tr>
        <td>
          <ul class="list-unstyled d-flex gap-mini">
            <div>❌</div><li>Forms with required fields tend to have the send button disabled until all required fields are correctly filled. The issue here is that with long forms or on small devices it's sometimes hard to spot the one field that was missed.</li>
          </ul>

          <ul class="list-unstyled d-flex gap-mini">

        </td>
      </tr>

            <div>❌</div><li>The user submits a form. While the client waits for the server response and to prevent double submission, the submit button gets disabled. The reason why this button gets disabled might not be obvious.</li>
          </ul>
        </td>
        <td>
          <ul class="list-unstyled d-flex gap-mini">
            <div>✔️</div><li>Provide a loading indicator or display a message that shows current progress when uploading large files. Disable duplicate form submissions internally by either aborting the current request and sending a new one or supressing new submissions during loading. Offer a remedy if the request timed out or an error occurred on the server (reload the page, retry form submission, ...).</li>
          </ul>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td colSpan="2" class="fw-bold">Disabled select options</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <ul class="list-unstyled d-flex gap-mini">
            <div>❌</div><li>Some options in a radio button group or select field are disabled because they are not available at this time or with the current configuration. This can be confusing because it's often unclear why these options are not available or how to enable them.</li>
          </ul>
        </td>
        <td>
          <ul class="list-unstyled d-flex gap-mini">
            <div>✔️</div>
            <li>
            There are multiple possible solutions, depending on the situation:
              <ul>
                <li>Don't display options that cannot be selected and reduce clutter in your UI.</li>
                <li>If you need to inform the user that there are potentially more possible options, show instructions on how to enable these options.</li>
                <li>Display read-only data as text and not in disabled form fields.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

## Labels

Labels are crucial in ensuring accessibility in web forms, as they provide necessary information about form elements for all users, especially those using assistive technologies like screen readers.

### Visible Labels
Use the `<label>` element along with the `for` attribute to create a link between a `<label>` and an `<input>` field.  The value of the `for` attribute must match the `id` of the corresponding `<input>` element, allowing screen readers to associate them correctly.

<Source code={visibleLabels} language="html" />


### Invisible Labels with `aria-label`
Make a hidden `<label>` element available for assistive technologies using the `aria-label` for labeling form elements. The `aria-label` attribute can be used to assign an accessible label to any form element that might not have a visible label.

<Source code={invisibleLabels} language="html" />


### Referencing Labels with `aria-labelledby`
The `aria-labelledby` attribute allows you to reference the `id` of another element that serves as the `<label>`. This is especially useful when the `<label>` is complex or spans multiple elements. Hidden elements can also be referenced using `aria-labelledby`, allowing screen readers to announce the associated label even though it is not displayed visually.


<Source code={referenceLabels} language="html" />


## Controls Grouping

When grouping `<form controls>`, the `<fieldset>`and `<legend>` elements play a critical role in providing context to screen readers. However, improper usage of these elements can lead to confusion for users with disabilities. 

<div class="table-responsive">
  <table className="table caption-top">
    <caption>Common mistakes and how to avoid them.</caption>
    <colgroup>
      <col style={{width: '50%'}} />
      <col style={{width: '50%'}} />
    </colgroup>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td colSpan="2" class="fw-bold">The `<legend>` element is not a direct child of the `<fieldset>`</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <ul class="list-unstyled d-flex gap-mini">
            <div>❌</div><li>A `<div>` or other element is incorrectly used as the first child of a `<fieldset>` with the `<legend>` nested inside this element.</li>
          </ul>
          
        </td>
        <td>
          <ul class="list-unstyled d-flex gap-mini">
            <div>✔️</div><li>Always place the `<legend>` right after the `<fieldset>` to preserve the association.</li>
          </ul>
        </td>
      </tr>
       <tr>
        <td colSpan="2" class="fw-bold">A `<div>` is used for grouping instead of `<fieldset>`</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <ul class="list-unstyled d-flex gap-mini">
            <div>❌</div><li>For visual reasons, a `<div>` is used for grouping controls instead of `<fieldset>`. No ARIA roles or attributes are set, failing to provide the necessary semantic meaning on assistive technologies.</li>
          </ul>
          
        </td>
        <td>
          <ul class="list-unstyled d-flex gap-mini">
              <div>✔️</div><li>Assign the `role="group"` to the `<div>` element to provide it with the semantic meaning of a `<fieldset>`. Use `aria-labelledby` or `aria-describedby` to associate any descriptive text with the grouping container to ensure that screen readers can provide context to users.</li>
          </ul>
        </td>
