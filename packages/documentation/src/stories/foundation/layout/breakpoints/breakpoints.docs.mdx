# Breakpoints

<div className="lead">
  Breakpoints are widths that determine how the responsive layout behaves across device or viewport
  sizes.
</div>

## Available breakpoints

The Swiss Post Design System includes
<span>{Object.keys(SCSS_VARIABLES.breakpoint).length}</span>
breakpoints, sometimes referred to as grid tiers, for building responsively. These breakpoints can be customized if you’re using our source Sass files.

<BreakpointTable />

You’ll find these breakpoints in a Sass map in our styles core.

<Source
  code={SampleAvailable}
  language="scss"
/>

## Mixins

There are several mixins available to use in your own Sass to help with building responsive layouts.

### Min-width

We primarily use the following media query ranges—or breakpoints—in our source Sass files for our layout, grid system, and components.

<Source
  code={SampleMinWidth}
  language="scss"
/>

### Max-width

We occasionally use media queries that go in the other direction.

<Source
  code={SampleMaxWidth}
  language="scss"
/>

### Single breakpoint

There are also media queries and mixins for targeting a single segment of screen sizes using the minimum and maximum breakpoint widths.

<Source
  code={SampleSingle}
  language="scss"
/>

### Between breakpoints

Similarly, media queries may span multiple breakpoint widths.

<Source
  code={SampleBetween}
  language="scss"
/>
