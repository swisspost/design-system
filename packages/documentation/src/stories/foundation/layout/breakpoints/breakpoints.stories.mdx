# Breakpoints

<div class="lead">
  Breakpoints are widths that determine how the responsive layout behaves across device or viewport
  sizes.
</div>

## Available breakpoints

The SwissPost Design-System includes {Object.keys(SCSS_VARIABLES.breakpoint).length} breakpoints, sometimes referred to as grid tiers, for building responsively. These breakpoints can be customized if you’re using our source Sass files.

<BreakpointTable />

You’ll find these breakpoints in a Sass map in our styles core.

```css dark
@use '@swisspost/design-system-styles/core' as post;

@each $key, $value in post.$grid-breakpoints {
  ...;
}
```

## Mixins

There are several mixins available to use in your own Sass to help with building responsive layouts.

### Min-width

We primarily use the following media query ranges—or breakpoints—in our source Sass files for our layout, grid system, and components.

```css dark
// No media query necessary for xs breakpoint as it's effectively @media (min-width: 0) { ... }
.custom-class {
  display: none;
}

@include media-breakpoint-up(lg) {
  .custom-class {
    display: block;
  }
}
```

### Max-width

We occasionally use media queries that go in the other direction.

```css dark
// No media query necessary for xs breakpoint as it's effectively @media (max-width: 0) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-down(lg) {
  .custom-class {
    display: none;
  }
}
```

### Single breakpoint

There are also media queries and mixins for targeting a single segment of screen sizes using the minimum and maximum breakpoint widths.

```css dark
@include media-breakpoint-only(xs) {
  .custom-class {
    display: block;
  }
}
```

### Between breakpoints

Similarly, media queries may span multiple breakpoint widths.

```css dark
@include media-breakpoint-between(sm, lg) {
  .custom-class {
    display: block;
  }
}
```
