# Container

Containers give responsive padding and margins to contents on a webpage. As our grid is based on Bootstrap, negative margins are used. Therefore, containers are required to wrap the grid to prevent unintended side-effects.

<Canvas of={ContainerStories.Default} />

# Fluid

`.container-fluid` has no padding regardless of viewport by default.

There is the option to specify a breakpoint `.container-fluid-[breakpoint]` which will add a padding for this breakpoint till the next bigger breakpoint.

# Reset

`.container-reset` can be used on elements inside a container, so the padding effect can be prevented. This is done with a negative margin. Do not use this outside of a container or inside a fluid container.

- `container-reset-left` left side only.
- `container-reset-right` right side only.
