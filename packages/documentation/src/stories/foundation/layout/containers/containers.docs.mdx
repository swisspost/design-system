# Containers

<div className="lead">
  Containers are essential layout elements ensuring content is aligned and properly padded across all devices and viewports.
</div>

<div className="alert alert-info">
  Containers are required when using the <a href="/?path=/docs/7240f2ef-216a-490e-9bd8-c0cef19f7b31--docs">grid system</a>.
</div>

There is two types of containers:

## Container

The `.container` adapts its width based on the viewport size, but it will not exceed 1280px.
This ensures content stays centered and does not stretch too wide on large screens.

<Source code={`<div class="container">
  <!-- Content goes here -->
</div>`} language="scss"/>

## Fluid Container

The `.container-fluid` spans the entire width of the viewport, regardless of its size.
Use this for layouts where the content should stretch edge-to-edge, even on large screens.

<Source code={`<div class="container-fluid">
  <!-- Content goes here -->
</div>`} language="scss"/>
