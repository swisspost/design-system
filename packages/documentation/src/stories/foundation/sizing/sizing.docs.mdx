# Sizing

## Post-Sizes Reference Table

<Canvas of={SizingStories.Table} />

## Height & Width

Height and width can be set using `h-*` and `w-*` prefixes, max-height and max-width can be set using prefixes mh-_ and mw-_ .

Bootstrap offers sizing classes with the following number suffixes: `*-25` , `*-50?` , `*-75` , `*-100` . They allow you to set a height / width as a percentage (see [Bootstrap Sizing](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/utilities/sizing/) for reference).

Post sizes can be used in the same way: by adding the name of the desired size to a prefix (to find out which size name to use, see the "Size name in classes" column in the reference table above or use the demo below).

## Padding & Margin

Padding and margin can be set using `p*` and `m*` prefixes.

You can apply the desired margin / padding all around an element using the prefix alone ( `m-*` / `p-*` ), or you can specify a position (ex: `pt-` , `pb-` , `pe-` , `ps-` respectively for a padding at top, bottom, right and left). You can also set a margin/padding along the horizontal axis (i.e. right and left) using `px-` / `mx-` or along the vertical axis (i.e. top and bottom) using `py`- / `my-` .

Bootstrap offers spacing classes with suffixes going from 0 to 5 ( `*-0` , `*-1` , `*-2` , ...) (see "Bootstrap Spacing" link above for reference).

Post sizes can be used in the same way: by adding the name of the desired size to a prefix (to find out which size name to use, see the "Size name in classes" column in the reference table above or use the demo below).

#### Example

<Canvas of={SizingStories.MarginPadding} />
<div className="hide-col-default">
  <Controls of={SizingStories.MarginPadding} />
</div>

# Responsive behaviour

By default, the above classes apply to all breakpoints.

If you need to change the size or spacing of an element based on the breakpoint, you should mention it in the class name using one of the following infixes: `*-sm-*` , `*-rg-*` , `*-md-*` , `*-lg-*` , `*-xl-*` , `*-xxl-*` . When a breakpoint is specified, the size applies to that breakpoint and to all those that are larger.

Another way to define a responsive size is to use the `*-r` suffix. It allows to obtain a size which updates automatically and consistently depending on the breakpoint, without having to specify anything manually.
