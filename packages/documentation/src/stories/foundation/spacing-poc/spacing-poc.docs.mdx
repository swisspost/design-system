Here is a small POC to show how the margins between different elements work together.

## How it works

Margins come from tokens and the rule in CSS is that when there are two margins between two elements, the space will be the biggest margin of the two.

Example: If `<h1>` has a margin-bottom of 32px and the following `<p>` has a margin-top of 16px, the margin between the two elements will be 32px (the margin-bottom of the `<h1>` element).

## Example

The spaces where the background is light blue is the spacing set by the margin tokens that are set for the headings and paragraphs.

The yellow background is simply to illustrate how it would look within a section element.
