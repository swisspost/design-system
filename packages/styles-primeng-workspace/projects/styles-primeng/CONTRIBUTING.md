# Contributing to the Design System Styles for PrimeNg

## Setup

These contribution guidelines extend the [general contribution guidelines](../../../../CONTRIBUTING.md). This library was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.0.

## Code scaffolding

**Attention**: When running commands from the design-system root folder, you'd need to prefix your `ng` commands with

`pnpm --filter design-system-styles-primeng-workspace exec ng ...`

Alternatively, you can `cd packages/styles-primeng-workspace` and run commands from this location without prefix.

## Build

Run `ng build styles-primeng` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist` directory of the components angular package.

## Publishing

Use the publishing workflow as described in the [Contribution Guidelines](../../../../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Further help
