[Styles for PrimeNg Documentation](https://design-system.post.ch/?path=/docs/d2112bed-c611-4098-a1ad-e654f7d622e7--docs)

## Installation

To install the package in a project run:

```bash
npm install primeng @swisspost/design-system-styles-primeng
```

The PrimeNg theme and core styles are the necessary, as well as the Swiss Post styles.
All three should be imported in the main style file of your Angular project, usually `src/styles.scss`.

Be sure to assign a layer to the Design System styles to avoid interference.

### With styles.css
```scss
@use "@swisspost/design-system-styles-primeng/primeng-theme";
@use "primeng/resources/primeng.css";

@layer design-system-styles, primeng;

// refer to the @swisspost/design-system-styles installation guidelines to know which bundle-name and extension to choose for your project
@import '@swisspost/design-system-styles/<bundle-name>.<extension>' layer(design-system-styles);
```
