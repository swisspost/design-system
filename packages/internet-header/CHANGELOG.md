(by [@gfellerph](https://github.com/gfellerph) with [#1462](https://github.com/swisspost/design-system/pull/1462))

- Added abort controller for all existing post-search search endpoints, to avoid running parallel calls for the same endpoint and therefore get outdated suggestions in the search suggestion list.
