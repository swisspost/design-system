# @swisspost/design-system-components

## 7.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Added a `heading-level` property on the `post-accordion` component to set the heading level of all `post-accordion-item` children at once. (by [@alizedebray](https://github.com/alizedebray) with [#3067](https://github.com/swisspost/design-system/pull/3067))

### Patch Changes

- Merged the card-control, checkbox-card and radio button card docs pages and updated the choice-card-control styles. (by [@oliverschuerch](https://github.com/oliverschuerch) with [#2847](https://github.com/swisspost/design-system/pull/2847))

- Fixed high-contrast-mode for card-control component. (by [@oliverschuerch](https://github.com/oliverschuerch) with [#2995](https://github.com/swisspost/design-system/pull/2995))

- Fixed the `post-accordion-item` chevron no longer rotating. (by [@alizedebray](https://github.com/alizedebray) with [#3081](https://github.com/swisspost/design-system/pull/3081))
- Updated dependencies:
  - @swisspost/design-system-styles@7.1.0

## 7.0.0

### Major Changes

- Synchronized the versions of the following packages:

  - @swisspost/design-system-styles
  - @swisspost/design-system-components
  - @swisspost/design-system-components-react
  - @swisspost/design-system-components-angular
  - @swisspost/design-system-migrations
  - @swisspost/design-system-icons
  - @swisspost/design-system-intranet-header

  This will help understanding the dependencies between these packages at a glance but also means that for the individual pacakges, semver is no longer being used. This enables us also to talk about and document Design System versions as a whole instead of documenting the fragmented versions in a complex lookup table. (by [@gfellerph](https://github.com/gfellerph) with [#2856](https://github.com/swisspost/design-system/pull/2856))

- Updated the package entry properties in the package.json to the by stencil recommended files:

  - Updated the `main` property from `loader/index.cjs.js` to `dist/index.cjs.js`
  - Updated the `module` property from `loader/index.js` to `dist/loader.js`
  - Updated the `types` property from `loader/index.d.ts` to `dist/types/index.d.ts`
  - Removed the `es2017` property

  The usage of the `@swisspost/design-system-components/loader` entry files are still available and should be used to get the lazy-loaded components. (by [@oliverschuerch](https://github.com/oliverschuerch) with [#2886](https://github.com/swisspost/design-system/pull/2886))

- Prefixed all web-component custom-events with the keyword `post`.
  - Changed `post-alert` component `dismissed` event to `postDismissed`.
  - Changed `post-card-control` component `input` and `change` events to `postInput` and `postChange`.
  - Changed `post-collapsible` component `collapseChange` event to `postToggle`.
  - Changed `post-rating` component `input` and `change` events to `postInput` and `postChange`.
  - Changed `post-tabs` component `tabChange` event to `postChange`. (by [@oliverschuerch](https://github.com/oliverschuerch) with [#2874](https://github.com/swisspost/design-system/pull/2874))

- Added a new web-component `post-card-control`, which works like a native `input[type="checkbox"]` or `input[type="radio"]` but with a custom visual design. (by [@oliverschuerch](https://github.com/oliverschuerch) with [#2260](https://github.com/swisspost/design-system/pull/2260))

- Added the new default slot, to allow the integration of custom HTML in the card-control component. (by [@oliverschuerch](https://github.com/oliverschuerch) with [#2844](https://github.com/swisspost/design-system/pull/2844))

- Fixed Collapsible and Accordion element's content which is displayed when hidden on Webkit/Safari. (by [@imagoiq](https://github.com/imagoiq) with [#2963](https://github.com/swisspost/design-system/pull/2963))

- Added new black and white alpha colors. Replaced hardcoded alpha colors with the new color definitions in `card-control` component. (by [@oliverschuerch](https://github.com/oliverschuerch) with [#2861](https://github.com/swisspost/design-system/pull/2861))

- Updated Sass color variables: - Removed variables `$success-green`, `$error-red`, `$warning-orange`, `$success-text`, `$error-text`, `$danger` as well as the Sass map `$contextual-colors`.
  Instead use the variables `$success`, `$error`, `$warning` and the Sass map `$signal-colors`.

  - Updated the Sass map `$signal-colors` keys and added a new Sass map `$signal-background-colors`.
  - Updated the Sass map `$background-colors` and all the dependant packages accordingly.

  With the exception of the components `notification`, `toast` and `tag`, there is no component providing a `danger` variant anymore. Instead use the `error` variant. (by [@oliverschuerch](https://github.com/oliverschuerch) with [#2861](https://github.com/swisspost/design-system/pull/2861))

    <p>Contentus momentus vero siteos et accusam iretea et justo.</p>
  </post-collapsible>
  ```

  <post-accordion-item collapsed="" headingLevel="6">
    <span slot="header">Titulum</span>
    <p>Contentus momentus vero siteos et accusam iretea et justo.</p>
  </post-accordion-item>
  ```
