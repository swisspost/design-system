## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- The &lt;sup&gt; construct does not work as intended in most contexts, adding unnecessary and confusing spacing into changelogs. New intended format:
  - This is a contribution. (by username with #111)
  - This is a multiline contribution that needs
    a lot of text (by username with #111) (by [@gfellerph](https://github.com/gfellerph) with [#795](https://github.com/swisspost/design-system/pull/795))
