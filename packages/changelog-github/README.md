A changeset changelog message formatter used for generating custom changelog entries. The JavaScript file is used by changesets to fetch information about changesets from GitHub and add user as well as pull-request links.

Code was originally forked from https://github.com/changesets/changesets/tree/main/packages/changelog-github and adapted to our needs.
