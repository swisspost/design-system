      // optional
      $color: '#fc0',
      $width: 1em,
      $height: 1em
    );
  }
  ```

  AFTER:

  ````scss
  // Load icon(s) at the top of your file
  // For a single icon:
  @include post.custom-property('accessibility', './path/to/icon/folder');

  // For multiple icons in the same file:
  @include post.custom-property(('accessibility', 'arrow'), './path/to/icon/folder');

## 7.0.0

### Major Changes

- Synchronized the versions of the following packages:
  - @swisspost/design-system-styles
  - @swisspost/design-system-components
  - @swisspost/design-system-components-react
  - @swisspost/design-system-components-angular
  - @swisspost/design-system-migrations
  - @swisspost/design-system-icons
  - @swisspost/design-system-intranet-header

  This will help understanding the dependencies between these packages at a glance but also means that for the individual pacakges, semver is no longer being used. This enables us also to talk about and document Design System versions as a whole instead of documenting the fragmented versions in a complex lookup table.
